THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!\\n!\\nCongrats Laker's good win..All played good esp.on the defense..\\nCongratulations\\n🎊 LAKERS good win tonight!!!\\nGood road win tonight. Imagine the possibilities with a 100% healthy roster? Hopefully sometimes early in the new year everyone will be healthy.\\ngood future all are contributing to the team, more chemistry needed\\nWow amazing. 7 players in double digits score. Congratulations\\nLos Angeles Lakers. Ret well for the next game.\\nKudos to #AR and #MAXCHRISTIE, played good defense and locked Spida in the 4th. 💜💛\\nThe early success the Lakers✨are having don’t surprise me. You have to give them time to play together and form some type of team chemistry. This team is good enough to win a lot of NBA games.\\nLakers guards deserve their flowers in this game. They played excellent defense specially in the 4th.\\nMax Christie was actually nice with it today🔥\\nI knew Christie was gonna step up this season, so far so good. Can't wait to see how he's gonna do during finals, hopefully 💛💜\\nLakers win is always a great feeling. Thank you.\\nThis was a gritty win. Let’s keep it rolling against Philly\\nNext game in Philadelphia 10 points , 0 in the 2nd half 😂😂😂 this is who AD is lol\\nwow 7 player in double figure\\nI think Austin at the 3 in certain instances makes alot of since. Dlo, Christie, Reaves, Lebron, AD is a interesting lineup none the least...\\nWe were very lazy tonight with the turnovers and the Lazy defense. A win is a win though! Game ball goes to Max 💪🔥\\nCongrats team Lakers💜💛👏👏👏😍\\nLakeshow!!!!🔥\\nCongrats lakers 💜💛\\nCongrats LakersNation 👏 💜🤍💛🖤\\nGood job guys, keep it up 👍\\n8 played, 7 in double figures! Great team win!\\nThe Davis/LBJ tandem has 9 pds and a great team win. Bravo to them. The King in control Mode.\\nGood team win. Everyone contributing feels good. AD on the mend 👍\\nTerrific win. When AD is the main focus, it makes a huge difference. Having Wood and Hayes on the floor more makes a huge difference also.\\nKudos to Coach DHam... even with just 8 players, he was able to make full use of them!!! The coach definitely have guts and knows what he's doing playing Max Christie for 33 minutes (3rd to AD's 38 mins. & LBJ's 36 mins.)... it shows that it's not only offense, that win games, but also great defense... ;)\\nI can see atleast 8steals and 7blocks.\\n\\nDefense is clicking when AD came to play. His consistency is always under question. Consistency is much more of a concern than his health lately.\\nLakers got better with the DEFENSIVE rebounding. Finished the game rebounding 73% of Cleveland's misses, while Cleveland rebounded 70% of LA's misses. And LA got the win. Going forward, defensive rebounding needs to be a point of emphasis...espe\\ncially against good shooting teams...you can't be giving those teams second chances and expect to win.\\nReaves to the rescue cleaning up Lebron technical. It was a close game but we got em!\",\n"," \"CONGRATULATIONS👏!!!!!!! TEAM WORK!!! TEAM SPIRIT!!!!! I GOT YOUR BACK!!!!!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!

Especially in 3-point shooting where LBJ kept on missing at the last minute!\\nAD needs to show up every game. So far he's consistently inconsistent.\\nThat was an amazing game and a great comeback! Davis was on fire, Reaves was amazing in the last quarter and of course Lebron showed why he's one of the best\\nawesome win ... the refs havee become predictable in the way they cheat the Lakers. 😢\\nThere was absolutely no defense in the first quarter Allowing 40 points.\\nThey beat the Cavs, my goodness with the star Power they have, they should be a undefeated, 🤦\\u200d♂️😂\\nPlease put Reeves back in the starting lineup\\nThey should try out Christie on every opposing teams primary scorer. He did good on Mitchell tonight\\nI hope ham will never use a small ball and Dlo must be benched in the 4th quarter\\nKudos to #MAXCHRISTIE and #AR! Played defense really well, locking up Spida. 💜💛\\nIf we get this AD every game we’ll be unstoppable\\nGreat win Lakeshow 💜💛\\nConsidering that DLo was the Cavs best player outstanding result.\\nA win is a win, will take it\\nLakers has a depth especially when vando and cam also rui\\nNice win!

We should've won the game. Come on. Let's bounce back next games.\\nWhat a disappointing loss, their coach should call a time out and make the right play. They still have 20 seconds to do that. Coach blunder 🤔\\nBack to back miscues from James probably cost them the game. Dang! And he was playing phenomenally up to that point too!

In the previous seasons, I often found myself disheartened witnessing LeBron making questionable decisions, such as persistently attempting three-pointers despite missing many and displaying hesitancy to drive to the basket, instead settling for difficult fadeaway jumpers from the perimeter. His reluctance to exploit his unstoppable penetration capabilities was perplexing.\\n\\nHowever, this season has seen a remarkable transformation.\\nLeBron\\'s shooting percentage has soared significantly, attributed to his strategic shift towards opting for higher-percenta\\nge shots and abandoning the tendency to force three-pointers.\\nHe has become notably more efficient and, without a doubt, more lethal on the court than ever before.\\n6 wins over the last 7 games.

We needed him last night and this dude scores 10 points 😡😡 Ridiculous!!\\nGreat words then AD plays like he is 38 geez, softer than pudding.\\nAge is ONLY a number. It is all about how you take care of yourself, preventing injuries, and what kind of injury history you have had of course. Many many slow down due to injury history causing their joints to slow them down and not be as explosive and consistent like they use to. Klay Thompson is a big example of this. There are also many who start losing interest in their 30s causing less aggressiveness and more laziness and then they try to hide their interest so they can still get paid. James loves basketball and he has more motivation than ever now. With his age though, he does have to work harder to keep playing at the level he is playing at.

It's impressive how he's performing at such a high level, even at 38 years old. He's definitely a force to be reckoned with on the court! 🏀🔥\\nLakers are pathetic.

Steph Curry could as well.\\nIMO if it isn’t done in the same time or less it doesn’t count. He could stay in league another 20 years until he owns all the records.

He can secure rebound and he plays soft for today\\'s videos.\\nTrade him. Can easy get a good tarde on some upcoming young players.\\nLebron didn’t start with strong 3 point skill. He worked very hard to develop his long range shot.

Also with all the rule changes from the start of the NBA and changes that\\'ll happen in the future, it isn\\'t a fair title to give anyone.\\nDavis is flat and playing soft\\nYa right. Leads the NBA in missed 3 point attempts. Kobe was better\\n1st all time in turnovers.\\nNothing like watching the Lakers lose! Love it every time!\\nEverytime he breaks a record his team gets blown out. 🤣 🤣\\nTo bad they don\\'t have a good team around him. Nothing more than a .500 team Be lucky to even make the playoffs\\nAt this point, whatever LeBron does is a record I guess 😭\\n👑King LeBron James👑\\nAmericans like to act like numbers dont matter when it comes to Bron and Drake ... this gentleman is in Top 10 of almost everything in basketball 🐐\\nStats don\\'t guarantee championships.\\nAnthony Davis is going to pad his stats in the fourth quarter make seem like he had a real good game\\nDavis playing flat and playing soft settling for 3pts if we keep playing the way we playing we are going to lose this game sad but true.',\n"," \"Not really.

He’s looking good. I’d play him more if I were the Lakers. The kid is a baller\\nKid\\'s a grinder. Good on him!\\nHe deserve more time this young fella\\nThis is why it’s a better strategy to have 2 stars with 13 really good players over 3 Max salary players and struggling to round out the roster. Eight guys played last night, 7 in double figures. Made it pretty tough to double team AD last night. Still with 3 key contributors out. Rob Pelinka\\U0001fae1\\nGive him more time to play..Go max\\nDare I say, he seems a little bit young Kobe-ish when i see the highlights. Hope he keeps it up.\\nAlways my new kobe but afro version.\\nHis confidence and the fact that he clearly worked on his game really stands out.\\nThis team has good pieces… it’s still early… once we get rotations in place… and coach learns to lean on the hot hand… lakers will be ok… we don’t need to trade for another star player… if anything a natural center for defense and rebounds…take some of that loud off AD… we still got Vando out with an injury… he’ll be big for us on D too… cam wood AR Rui are playing good…\\ngood Game Max keep it up\\nMax at its max. He\\'s confident now.\\nI would too. I’ll show case my talent.\\nI’ve been telling this kid is special just the coach is blind.\\nMax showcasing his talent! Last year it was AR15, this year it\\'s Max\\'s turn. Great job coaching staff.\\nGive him a more minute to play\\nGood game max!! 💪🔥💪🔥\\ngood game\\nI have been said that Max is who the Lakers want Gabe to be!\\nHe’s a good defender too.\\nJust like horton-tucker, need some quality minutes to raise his value, hopefully some decent teams pick him up. Tho lakers might not let him for now\\nIf someone will be given their chance, they can show their worth...\\nI saw Kobe on Him..Lakers must give this guy more playing time..He\\'s a treasure someday!!\\nGiven more exposure he might turn out to be better than AR, not saying AR is bad\\nThese young guns should be given more times to develop their A games like those other teams are doing.\\nLebron was just chillin at this game.\\nIf the squad played this good consistently, then we would have a good chance. Let\\'s go lakers 🔥💯\\nHe guarded Mitchell at the last minute and it works. Good job young fella 👏\\nNo rookies played this time.for the lakers except for max Christie on his 2nd year. Is this the policy of the coaching mgt. They treat the rookies as waiting party\\nHope Jalen hood make his debut .\\nAll haters to the podium\\nGreat job young fella 💪 . CONGRATULATIONS👏 LAKERS!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!! TEAM WORK!!!!!! TEAM SPIRIT!!!!!!! TEAM RESPECT!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!!!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!!!!!\\n!! THAT\\'S WHAT I\\'M TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!\\n!\\nCongrats Laker\\'s good win..All played good esp.on the defense..\\nCongratulations\\n🎊 LAKERS good win tonight!!!\\nGood road win tonight. Imagine the possibilities with a 100% healthy roster? Hopefully sometimes early in the new year everyone will be healthy.\\ngood future all are contributing to the team, more chemistry needed\\nWow amazing. 7 players in double digits score. Congratulations\\nLos Angeles Lakers. Ret well for the next game.\\nKudos to #AR and #MAXCHRISTIE, played good defense and locked Spida in the 4th. 💜💛\\nThe early success the Lakers✨are having don’t surprise me. You have to give them time to play together and form some type of team chemistry. This team is good enough to win a lot of NBA games.\\nLakers guards deserve their flowers in this game. They played excellent defense specially in the 4th.\\nMax Christie was actually nice with it today🔥\\nI knew Christie was gonna step up this season, so far so good. Can\\'t wait to see how he\\'s gonna do during finals, hopefully 💛💜\\nLakers win is always a great feeling. Thank you.\\nThis was a gritty win. Let’s keep it rolling against Philly\\nNext game in Philadelphia 10 points , 0 in the 2nd half 😂😂😂 this is who AD is lol\\nwow 7 player in double figure\\nI think Austin at the 3 in certain instances makes alot of since. Dlo, Christie, Reaves, Lebron, AD is a interesting lineup none the least...\\nWe were very lazy tonight with the turnovers and the Lazy defense. A win is a win though! Game ball goes to Max 💪🔥\\nCongrats team Lakers💜💛👏👏👏😍\\nLakeshow!!!!🔥\\nCongrats lakers 💜💛\\nCongrats LakersNation 👏 💜🤍💛🖤\\nGood job guys, keep it up 👍\\n8 played, 7 in double figures! Great team win!\\nThe Davis/LBJ tandem has 9 pds and a great team win. Bravo to them. The King in control Mode.\\nGood team win. Everyone contributing feels good. AD on the mend 👍\\nTerrific win. When AD is the main focus, it makes a huge difference. Having Wood and Hayes on the floor more makes a huge difference also.\\nKudos to Coach DHam... even with just 8 players, he was able to make full use of them!!! The coach definitely have guts and knows what he\\'s doing playing Max Christie for 33 minutes (3rd to AD\\'s 38 mins. & LBJ\\'s 36 mins.)... it shows that it\\'s not only offense, that win games, but also great defense... ;)\\nI can see atleast 8steals and 7blocks.\\n\\nDefense is clicking when AD came to play. His consistency is always under question. Consistency is much more of a concern than his health lately.\\nLakers got better with the DEFENSIVE rebounding. Finished the game rebounding 73% of Cleveland\\'s misses, while Cleveland rebounded 70% of LA\\'s misses. And LA got the win. Going forward, defensive rebounding needs to be a point of emphasis...espe\\ncially against good shooting teams...you can\\'t be giving those teams second chances and expect to win.\\nReaves to the rescue cleaning up Lebron technical. It was a close game but we got em! . CONGRATULATIONS👏!!!!!!! TEAM WORK!!! TEAM SPIRIT!!!!! I GOT YOUR BACK!!!!!!!! I BELIEVE!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!!\\nFew mo wins and we up up n away…🚀\\nThe Lake Show\\nWe all know whats going to happen next game with AD. 11-9-1\\nReaves a beast on those last rebounds and took that hit on the floor like a champ.\\nLeBron was literally trying to give this game away SMH thank God it was Reaves that was taking the late game freethrows.\\n🙌 👏 I’m proud of Los Angeles Lakers\\nMad for the “shouldve won the game” from last game but i’m happy we got the W tonight. Can’t wait to see how the Lakers play against one of the top teams (Philly).\\nYes!!!!! Congratulations\\nLakers 💜💛💜💛💜💛👏\\nYesssss! It feels good Lakers!👑💜💛🏀\\nWow, how did that happen?\\nWe got the right AD tonight. Sloppy all game but still a great win!\\nLakers win is always a great feeling. Thank you.\\nLet’s go Lakers 🔥🔥🔥🦾🦾🦾THE TIME IS NOW WE GOING TO WIN EVERYTHING LBJ THE KING 🤴 THE GOAT 🐐 AD PUT SOME🦾🦾 THAT’S ALL WE NEED TO WIN EVERYTHING 🥇🏆\\nThey need to improve a lot to win every single game! Especially in 3-point shooting where LBJ kept on missing at the last minute!\\nAD needs to show up every game. So far he\\'s consistently inconsistent.\\nThat was an amazing game and a great comeback! Davis was on fire, Reaves was amazing in the last quarter and of course Lebron showed why he\\'s one of the best\\nawesome win ... the refs havee become predictable in the way they cheat the Lakers. 😢\\nThere was absolutely no defense in the first quarter Allowing 40 points.\\nThey beat the Cavs, my goodness with the star Power they have, they should be a undefeated, 🤦\\u200d♂️😂\\nPlease put Reeves back in the starting lineup\\nThey should try out Christie on every opposing teams primary scorer. He did good on Mitchell tonight\\nI hope ham will never use a small ball and Dlo must be benched in the 4th quarter\\nKudos to #MAXCHRISTIE and #AR! Played defense really well, locking up Spida. 💜💛\\nIf we get this AD every game we’ll be unstoppable\\nGreat win Lakeshow 💜💛\\nConsidering that DLo was the Cavs best player outstanding result.\\nA win is a win, will take it\\nLakers has a depth especially when vando and cam also rui\\nNice win! Bravo Reeves, Woods, Hayes, Christie & AD! Lakers 💜\\nAD actually played like he wanted to win tonight and Austin put in a solid game too little off night for bron but all in all it’s a dub🙌🏀 . Fabulous, magnificent, brilliant team players.\\nGreat game 👏👏👏 the bench was good👏👏\\nI absolutely live this in that, they haven\\'t forgotten where their blessings of talent, skills, basketball I,Q , health, success and longevity comes from\\nAlways be grateful, it helps to keep you humble.\\nLakers lost again big time..\\nWinning is mental. MJ has one of the strongest will to win, has the mental strength, has the killer instincts, and has the intelligence to figure out the way to win. LeBronze could only wish he had those because he is mentally weaker compared to MJ.\\nGreat players 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\\nGood luck\\nGood luck❤️❤️❤️\\nGood luck ❤️🎈💙\\nAll the best Lakeshow💜💛\\n\\nTope\\nGooood luck 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍\\nGood lucky!!! Lakers💜\\nThe last play was a good effort, but it lacked help. A good screenplay could have made it. You all have to make all your free throws count. You could have won the game, if you made all of them. Also, learn and use the glass whenever you\\'re on an angle or right below the rim. The glass is every ballers best friend.\\nYou do realize that once LeBron starts failing again, he will throw his teammates under the bus or make excuses to the media. It’s what he does it’s how he truly is.\\nCorrection I meant to say I absolutely love this instead of live this.\\nQueen James and his court\\nThe king praying to the king of kings Jesus ☝🏽\\U0001faf6🏽\\nI love brother hood but Davis can\\'t hold Cavs. That\\'s pitiful\\nI like when they pray before the game.\\nThat hairline gets better every year 😆\\nGood luck my Lakers\\nGo Do Work! 🤘🏾👊🏾🔥💯\\nPraying 🙏🏼changes things for better!

They still have time(20 seconds)... why not call for timeout to make some plays... it happened again... they never learned their lesson...and yet on 2.8 secs, they called for timeout...calli\\nng HAM\\nWe just fell short tonight due to some lapses on dying seconds. We should\\'ve won the game. Come on. Let\\'s bounce back next games.\\nWhat a disappointing loss, their coach should call a time out and make the right play. They still have 20 seconds to do that. Coach blunder 🤔\\nBack to back miscues from James probably cost them the game. Dang! And he was playing phenomenally up to that point too! Anyway backend of a back-to-back and minus Reddish and Vando, that was always almost a loss 😢😂\\nDavis Is soft only plays well against bad teams\\nIn the face of defeat,we find opportunity to improve and grow,fight lakers in the next game,\\nLet\\'s go purple and gold 💛💜💛💜💛💜👊👊👊👊\\nLove it. When they WIN, LEBRON IS GREAT AND THE REASON. When they LOSE LEBRON IS STILL GREAT AND NEVER THE REASON THEY LOST. HE NEVER HAS OR WILL TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY WHEN HIS TEAMS LOSE.\\nI\\'m telling you: if scores are tied Lechoke will take the Shot confidently because it\\'s just either WIN or OT but if an Opponent is leading then he will pass it because it\\'s either WIN OR LOSS, he has no guts in this case. If you\\'re watching his game then you know what I\\'m talking about.\\nY’all had it in the bag…and y’all choke 🤦🏽\\u200d♂️\\nThe best Coach for the Lakers is Phil Jackso. He needs to be back for the NBA season to win the NBA 2023 - 2024 championship title, because I was a little bit confuse about coach Darwin Ham coaching style. Hopefully, my suggestion will be accepted.\\nThe king is on fire 🔥\\nThe turnover King at it again. How come nobody keeps the stats of how many games players are responsible for losing? The missed free throws alone are horrendous…….\\nLots of great plays, with lots of bonehead plays....trying\\nbe the hero\\nOne of the best fourth quarters I\\'ve seen and then absolute garbage for the last 30 seconds.\\nI’m so disappointed at AD. How can he be so inconsistent especially on a game like this? They could have won this. Smh\\nWell no.excuss but they did play back to back games the other team was well rested. But they did make a big come back but just fell.short\\ngrats Dallas but thats a Great Game #Lakeshow\\nWE lose but WE Did a great match like WE Did in Miami 2 weeks ago 👏👏👏\\ncoach bat kc dika nag timeout😅\\nLebron shot a three pointer when he had Kyrie and pass the ball leads to turnover when he also had kyrie.🤦\\nWhen is AD goimg to become a consistant player, good game followed by 10 points..... not going to win another chip playing like that.\\nShot a 3 pointer when you’re up 2. What a wise decision 👏\\nAmd then Le Blow It throws a pass to Davis who\\'s under the basket but covered by two Maverick players... what was he thinking?\\nYup momentum LECHOKE😂🤣😂🤣!!! Last 3 possessions he CHOKED BIGTIME😂🤣😂!!!\\nImagine if they made those last 4 free throw shots……\\nLeBron should be out for the last minute each game\\nGuess this y’all last post of the night since Darvin chose to hold onto 2 timeouts when they were up with seconds to go. Acts like they’ll rollover to the next game when he could’ve used one to draw a play\\n\\nSame mistakes as last season 🤦\\u200d♂️\\nLeBron threw that game away !!! 😣😣😖￼\\nPass to AD under the basket.. 😭😭😭\\ndouble team on AD, why Bron did that \\U0001f979🤧😭😭😭😭 . LeBron messed up when they were poised for the win. Trying a hero 3 pointer and then throwing it away when he could have tried to drive for free throw chance or pass to someone open? Instead he tried a tough one to Davis and threw it all away. Great effort he played his part in the comeback attempt but that was poor end by Lebron\\nIf AD would actually play up to his talent the lakers would have been in a different position. AD just doesn’t have the heart, 10pts… come on dude\\nHappy Thanksgiving to everyone stay safe and stay positive. Let’s get it ￼\\nGood game\\nLechoke\\nDoesn’t matter, we lost. We can’t hang with the best teams in the league. It’s obvious we’re still not a good team.\\nGood game let’s go Lakers\\nThink the Lakers had turkey on their brain so they played like 💩\\nIt ought to be disappointing to fans come out and watch them and they casually playing when they should be attacking forcefully going for the killer shot. Kyrie took his 3 pt game Winner effortlessly\\nNo Laker used aggression, as they lose most games because they\\'re comfortable waiting for LeBron to be the 4th qrtr show, but it didn\\'t work this time huh?\\nBron missed his free throws, missed the hero 3, literally threw the ball away, and then missed another hero 3.\\n\\nGotta get that ball around better and more effectively\\nGood effort Lakers. The Mavericks are a great team. We only lost by 3 points not too shabby.\\n\\nHappy Thanksgiving 🎂\\nHappy Thanks Giving....Man, Lakers you\\'re the best Let\\'s just move to next game. WOW.. what i saw in the 4rd Quarter was so amazing. they lock mav down 30-13 run\\nDallas is one of the bad Defensive teams but the Lakers was worst last night!\\nMost of their games are like this, slow start, opponents will get a big lead, lakers will try to rally a comeback, then lakers will gas out and lose.\\nI was so sure Bron was gonna drive on that last possession and get fouled 💔 that comeback crazy\\nHappy 10 points Giving Anthony Davis\\nDavis did absolutely nothing to help with this come back. If he had maybe contributed atleast 2 or 3 buckets in the 4th quarter we could’ve won. Every shot he took was short.\\nGood Game L.A Lakers 💪💪🏆👏👑👑\\nOmg…heartbreaki\\nng..Lakers should’ve won after catching up last qrt still a great game🏀❤️🏀\\nLeBron threw that game away !!! 😣😣￼\\nso much for making the right play 🤣\\nUpdate score?\\nspettacolare.\\nLebron 😭🔥\\n92-95\\n💜🤍🖤💛\\n💜💛\\n💜🤍🖤💛\\nWhy blame LeBron for the lost when AD only had 10 points. When is AD going to step up and be Batman. Lebron has passed the torch to him, but he disappears in big games! AD doesn\\'t even want to be Robin. Lakers, please trade AD! 😡😡😡\\nCavs 76ers Pistons OKC and rockets .

They are so frustrating to watch now.\\nDon’t understand why AD is on the floor smiling when there losing 😡 absolutely no effort trying to rebound the basketball and just no defense whatsoever, Lakers are way better then this Mavs!!!!! #FireHam\\nThe Lakers are just asking to much from James. I don’t see him making it the whole season. If he gets hurt it’s over. Take him away, who will score, who will rebound and who will handle the ball. It’s a matter of time before this season is over and the Lakers force James into a early retirement. Then the Lakers will be unwatchable…\\nMy lakers performing good this year ...Las Angeles Lakers fo life .🏀💪\\nYup we about to blown out again 😏\\nThis game is a wrap. No heart out there\\n💜🤍🖤💛\\nfire darham\\nI\\'m curious why Han keep playing Woods , nothing he can do !\\nTrailing by 16 at halftime\\n💜🤍🖤💛\\nGo Lakers 💪🏀💪\\n🇺🇸🏀🏀🏀\\n💜💛\\n🔥🔥🔥\\nArchie Palisoc\\nFire them\\nWin or lose, Injured or healthy, LeBron will always be light years better than Michael Jackson.

End of the freaking story! 🤴🐐🔥\\nTypical lakers big game followed by a clunker\\nBLESS OUR LAKERS, AMEN 🙏\\nGood luck lakers\\nI\\'m would trade AD before he gets hurt tomorrow.\\nAnd it seems like they are about to lose this game against a better team . . . 😔\\nAnother Laker lost the last second of the game so fu, lol\\nTypical lakers,after a big win will always play poorly the next game\\nI guess this was one of them load management games where lebron and AD play sometimes in the game tonight lol\\nKyrie Irving proves to Lakers management how good he is.\\nThis team is an embarassment in terms of defense and shot selection. Lebron’s leadership in defense tonight is so whack not even trying to help\\nThere way to slow to beat mavs plus not enough shooters to keep up with mavs\\n60 M per year for AD is a garbage idea for Lakers 😭 . He\\'s so nice that he even signed Bron\\'s jersey 😅\\nExcellent!!!!! My favorite young player!!!!\\nThose jerseys on sale on ebay already!!!\\nLove it♥️🥰\\nAR brought us back in this game.

In the previous seasons, I often found myself disheartened witnessing LeBron making questionable decisions, such as persistently attempting three-pointers despite missing many and displaying hesitancy to drive to the basket, instead settling for difficult fadeaway jumpers from the perimeter. His reluctance to exploit his unstoppable penetration capabilities was perplexing.\\n\\nHowever, this season has seen a remarkable transformation.\\nLeBron\\'s shooting percentage has soared significantly, attributed to his strategic shift towards opting for higher-percenta\\nge shots and abandoning the tendency to force three-pointers.\\nHe has become notably more efficient and, without a doubt, more lethal on the court than ever before.\\n6 wins over the last 7 games. I\\'ll take it!\\ngood job! 💪🏾👑💜💛\\nLebron James 😊🥂❤\\nThe real goat is mj\\nPeople who do this for Leflop, messi, etc definitely don\\'t watch alot of sports.\\n\\nHonesty kobe is the best.\\n\\nWay better then LeBron.\\n\\nThese \"fans\" are out of control.\\nSo great, even great at leading the all time record for turnovers at a whopping 5k.

Thats what the LA Hype doesnt tell you !\\nThey barely won and lucky\\nWin everything, thus making all LeBron James HATERS extremely\\nmad!

Only one true celebrity Laker fan matters.\\nThe real celebrities are those who faithfully, year after year, through good seasons and bad seasons, show up, celebrate, and support The Lakers not court side but in the higher seats. We are the true celebrities!\\n#LetKaiPlay\\nThe only thing I want to know is who the tiny Asian lady with huge 🕶️ is who always sits court side…\\nI\\'d rather see the fans in the 300\\'s.

YES!!!!! A BROTHERHOOD AND RESPECT STATEMENT!!!! REAL!!!!! REAL FRIENDSHIP!!!!!\\nI BELIEVE!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!!\\n38 is just a number.\\nStill King 👑 James the best player\\nLast night showed that the team can do whatever they want. Guy keep this spirit,but better decisions.\\nI won\\'t say I\\'m happy but I\\'m optimistic\\nabout there future. There plan at the end of these games has gotten better. We need to break through that system of letting it be a two option decision on the closer at that point every body on the team is your closer . Let the younger stars emerge when we get Vanderbilt back a added defender it\\'s going to make a big difference 💯 family ✌️.\\nAD did it again. We needed him last night and this dude scores 10 points 😡😡 Ridiculous!!\\nGreat words then AD plays like he is 38 geez, softer than pudding.\\nAge is ONLY a number. It is all about how you take care of yourself, preventing injuries, and what kind of injury history you have had of course. Many many slow down due to injury history causing their joints to slow them down and not be as explosive and consistent like they use to. Klay Thompson is a big example of this. There are also many who start losing interest in their 30s causing less aggressiveness and more laziness and then they try to hide their interest so they can still get paid. James loves basketball and he has more motivation than ever now. With his age though, he does have to work harder to keep playing at the level he is playing at. Motivation, interest, consistency is key.\\nGO LA..GO LA💛💜🥳🥳\\nGreat players 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\\nYES LeBron is Enjoying his games.You can see it whilst he\\'s on d court.So Energetic.\\nReading d game ..Has a really high IQ when it comes to making decisions n controlling what happens on d court.Le Goat.Go get that trophy.\\nLeBron, I know it’s not new to you, but the fans in the media are excited you know the outcome and I’ll start to playoffs\\nShouldn\\'t that make you work harder,but it doesn\\'t, Lakers are wasting their money on AD. Only reason I think they are keeping him is because of LeBron, once LeBron leaves I would package him up out of there.\\nThat\\'s awesome to hear! It sounds like LeBron James is in incredible form. It\\'s impressive how he\\'s performing at such a high level, even at 38 years old. He\\'s definitely a force to be reckoned with on the court! 🏀🔥\\nLakers are pathetic. They must be given more free throws than all the other teams for them to win.\\nLet\\'s win the championship.\\nIf AD played like he should every game, we wouldn\\'t even need Lebron\\nGo Lakers, 🏀🏆\\nI bought those purple rain LeBron shoes. Love them.\\nAD 10 points wasn\\'t why the Lakers loss last night it was an ill responsible 3 point shot taking when you have a 2 point lead instead of driving to the basket for a layup or foul or take a time out to set up a play,then throw the ball in double coverage on AD come on man LeBron been in league to long to be still making them mistakes and bad decisions no excuses for someone who been in the league long as he has\\nGlad he stopped admiring the Joker enough to praise his own teammate. Needs killer instinct.\\nBron is having fun and davis is not having fun the guy is in prime play like it ,play some defense\\nHow can u be this good at 38 it’s insane. As a lakers fan you might not like this but I think mj is the goat but I think lebron is second and definitely the best ever old player.\\nDon\\'t mean anything...they\\ncan\\'t beat the good teams bad sign when playoffs start...😂😂😂\\nI know Bron is Bron but I feel like the reason AD falls off offensively sometimes is cuz he knows he has lebron vs in Nola when he was the guy🤔\\nthe prediction is lakers will fall again in the playoffs or sweep again by the nuggets or clippers\\nAD playing like he 38\\nPround of you Lebron James . You’re the exemple of the youth.\\nI have nieces and nephews older than him.\\nWe will never see it done again. He’s incredible. .

Veterans, keep “leading” - Keep encouraging and mentoring the young talent. Play as a unit and enjoy the challenge and competition and yes we love the the hard fought wins!\\nDespite his age, LeBron is everything for the team and Austin made the critical shot, congratulations\\nLakers.\\n6th seed for the #LakeShow 💜💛\\nIn my humble opinion Austin Reeves needs to be getting over 10 shots a game.\\nnice win🥰\\nCongratulations\\nLeBron James, Anthony Davis, Austin Reaves 🏀 🏆\\nLakeshow, baby!\\nLet\\'s get 4-0 next game vs jazz in in-season tournament and a 9-6 record💛💜💛💜🔥🔥🔥\\nExcellent game. Y\\'all keep the intensity and confidence on the offense and aggressiveness on your defense, but practice more on all your free throws. They\\'re all a factor with high importance. Make everything count.\\nLebron need help. Prince. Reddish and DRussell. 5 from 29 from FG and 6 TO\\nstupid reaves he let irving shot the 3s. if he know how to guard he didnt let irving make him shot that 3s. reaves has no defense like russel\\nLet’s go Lakers!!!!\\nlumalaban gyyd imong Labidabi Shaii Timkangg\\nThe goat and the future♥️♥️♥️ and the defensive player of the year\\nI love you all Lakers\\nI need a Lakers friend\\nI\\'m yelling King James... thank you bro.\\n👑King LeBron James👑\\nLeBron ❤️❤️❤️❤️\\nAD should be smart on his fouls this almost cost the game.\\nMy one and only idol 👑 James the 🐐\\nPlay basketball 🏀 boys!! 🏀🏀🏀🏀\\nGreatness Lakers Team😄👏💛💜\\nGood job\\nKing LeBron 🏀😍👑👑\\nGood team spirit ehh\\nLet\\'s goooooo!\\nCongrats lakers . Absolutely the right play. LeBron saw Brooks doubling down on him. Those who said LeBron trusted AR more than him don\\'t understand basketball.\\nLebron is actually training these young talents differently. Confidence, take the moment, no second thought, come what may, trust, clutch. Lebron is lifting his teammates, not scared to be bashed for his decisions.\\nIt’s nice to see Austin Reaves buzzer beater 🔥🥰\\nTHANK YOU🙏 AUSTIN REAVES!!!!FOR THE WIN!!!! THANK YOU🙏 KING JAMES FOR BELIEVING IN HIM!!!! THAT\\'S WHAT I CALL TEAM WORK !!!!TRUST!!! AND RESPECT AT IT\\'S BEST!!!! I BELIEVE!!!! I BELIEVE!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!\\nAustin Reaves! AR! Always Reliable when the team needs his shots. Whew 👏👏👏\\nGreat pass and great shot!\\nLebron and AR holding the ball and dribbling too long with the shot clock winding down. This often leads to a low percentage shot or a pass to a teammate with little or no time left on the shot clock. Need to get into offensive set sooner, run pick and roll, have more cutting and movement off the ball.\\nAR is a winner. Looked harried and hesitant at times. Other players wouldn\\'t have been able to step up. Lebron continues to amaze.\\nSo happy for him! Hated that everyone just called him overrated for no reason. He\\'s still HIM!\\nThis kid is something special, please dont let him go!\\nGive more chance throw trepoints for Austin Reeves\\nReaves, he’s becoming a superstar baby\\nAustin Reaves the legend 👏👏👏\\nI lab it...😍😍💜💛🔥💪🍻yahooo\\nLove him💛💜💛💜\\nI don’t know. Seems to me they took a long time to get to that point. I think it makes more sense to move around without the ball so you can get a better look instead of just holding it out there and running the shot clock down and having to take a 31-foot jumpshot. ￼￼\\nCurry really did ruin the game! Shooting as far out as possible for a 3 pointer is not more points. 3pts is 3pts lol. Now everybody thinks somehow this is good basketball shooting a super deep 3 . I think you could have better shot selection here Lebron!\\nHighest basketball.IQ ever...\\nSaw the double coming ..knew right away someone is wide open.. trusting his teammates can knock down the shot\\nY\\'all ballhog idols dont have that IQ..never\\nMJ would have taken the shot, LeBron always dishes it off.. this is why LeBron will never be the Goat\\nGreat shot! Love Reeves. Please stop this ice in vein. It’s old.\\nThat was insane, I remember halfway through that shot, I stopped watching, took a break and responded to a few emails, when I came back the ball hit the basket and it was 3pts 🥵🥵\\nBron doing the right play in every single night ,,\\n\\n#trustyourteamma\\ntes\\nthis dude reminds me of danny ainge\\nThe fact that Lebron trusts him to take a high-leverage shot late in the game is all anyone needs to know.\\nKnow say notting why lebron pass the ball? Owwwwww becuase Reaves knock down the shot!\\nAR-15 shot that 3 all the way from Austin, TX.\\nHis jumper is almost identical to a old player I can\\'t remember.\\nAustin Powers.. 😘💜💛\\nIf reaves miss that shot ppl would be hating on lebron for not taking it\\nLeBron is different\\nThe wey he trust his teammates it\\'s CRAZY yow 🔥🦁\\n\"You\\'re him\" Austin💪AR-15🏀 . Man\\'s forever in his prime it\\'s ridiculous\\nWhat this man is doing should be impossible. Respect greatness while it lasts, because we definitely won\\'t see someone like him again.😤🐐👑\\nIts amazing A almost 39y old guy Still enjoying playing So much minutes carrying a team to Win Clearly the greatest to ever play the game Name Basketball ☝️King forever Not a stupid Animal Called GOAT\\nThe coolest player in the history of the NBA\\nDon’t mean anything six final’s losses never 3 peated always flopping\\nOn the road to championship 18.\\nHey Bron, Jordan the GOAT right?\\nDespite his age, LeBron is everything for the team and Austin made the critical shot, congratulations\\nLakers.\\nHe is a superstars today. Tomorow he need help. 😂\\nInsufferable\\nThe greatest player KING 👑 GOAT 🐐\\nMJ BOAT 🚤 🤣🤣\\nYou really halted our heartbeat for a second Bron with that first missed free throw😁\\nReal iffy but a win is a win.\\nKing James dominates tonight!\\nI hate that he plays for the Lakers😔😔😔\\nJust before he almost handed the game away to them,not to mention his antics of taking a hit of a blunt . It\\'s a bad look for the KING OF EGO.\\nGet on the list of 3 peats winning championships then we can talk 😂😂😂\\nCONGRATULATIONS👏 LAKERS!!!!!! THANK YOU🙏 KING JAMES!!!!!!!!

Finally played a good team with all there players and outside of a comback they were down a lot most of the game and lost.

The GOAT 🐐👑\\nReaves too did a great job today 🔥💛💜\\nYou know what’s messed up? The fact that you got people hating him for passing to a wide open player for the last shot while he’s being doubled team. They come out of the woods if the player misses the shot but if he makes the shot they get quiet.\\nBron was out of his mind . What a game for him\\nAnother ring with Lakers as well as MVP.Still carrying these youngsters on his broad shoulders.Come on guys.Time to put in some work.This is not acceptable.You are a young team ..train harder n allow LeBron to breathe..He\\'s 38 not 18.Time to hit those buckets.Dont want him getting burnt out when he is needed for the playoffs.\\nBreaking News: A group of 14 young men have been found guilty of elder abuse, as they have been relying on an old man to carry them, and have been giving zero help to the victim.\\nIt\\'s a long season, I hope he paces himself strategically.\\nMan , for at that effort that this older great player is putting in his game. Mr. LeBron James ; it would be fantastic to see him getting another Ring with the Lakers before he retires 🙏💜💛\\nI already heard he had to get a tetanus shot because of all the scratches he got from Dillon Brooks 💯\\nWhile this is amazing let’s keep it a buck. Bron at 39 (almost) should not have to put up 30+ to beat the rockets by 1\\nMVP worthy Performance.\\nThe caption should be how he do that?

The best player of all time.🐐🐐🐐💪🔥💜💛🏆👑\\nYou ever notice how no matter what LeBron does people filter it through their own narratives. Like just because he\\'s still playing, and breaking records, they automatically assume he\\'s only playing to break records. Because of course he couldn\\'t possibly be playing because he loves the game, and can still perform at a high level. Just because he\\'s breaking records we automatically have to assume that\\'s his primary motivation.\\nCongratulations\\n! King James\\nThe man can do it all 🐐\\nIt took him 7 years longer, but hey good job\\nStealing All star players to be his team mates 😂\\nWhen he retired at 49 lol he gave 50k points 15k assist and rebounds lol and still 4 rings\\nAll time Scorer - not the 1, not 2 Scoring Titles, not even the greatest scoring average in playoffs or finals\\n8th All time Steals - not 1 Defensive player\\nLebum James still Chasing individual record awards, remember that he is playing now for 21 years season....its a complaiments🤣\\nWhen 🐍 was hitting milestones, a certain fan base loved to claim they were just longevity feats and don’t mean much. I guess times have changed.\\nCongratulations\\nLeBron!\\nHe rather be 6-0 in da finals!!! 😂😂😂😂\\nIf MJ played as many games he\\'d be number 1 in total steals and number 4 in steals per game\\nPlease get to 1st so my signed jersey in storage is worth more! Blue Lives Matter Le Bron!!! Dunbass.\\nCongratulations\\nhaters, I hope this will make you happy 🤣🤣😜😜👑💛💜💪\\nBut he don’t play defense they say.\\nI guess the other team just threw him the ball intentionally.\\nLebron is a lockdown defender. Just ask Derrick Rose in that playoff series what happened when GOAT James picked him up.\\nWhere does he fall on the all-time list for turnovers?\\nSo many yrs…. Yet will never touch John Stockton…. My boy stock deserves so much more recognition\\nSad that he has to hang around the league for years to try and break.records people who where actually great set in shorter period of time\\nat some point we should consider stopping Congrats due to the number of more years he\\'s played?\\nHater continues to be hating and watch God blessings\\nBreaking records is what will open eyes, not how many years it took Lebron to break them. The result is the real stat.\\nNext week!

Classic and clean 🔥.\\nThis 7 Players 💪\\nWhere Reaves ?\\nLooking Good\\nLezzz goooo purple & gold 💜💛\\nMy team lakers.❤️\\nThe beidge basketball association\\nLets go get the W Lakeshow\\n💜💛\\n💜💛\\nDon\\'t care what they look, just win a game respectfully\\nGood luck 🙌\\nTake care of turnovers guys!\\nHope they win 😂\\nLet\\'s go Goats #!..🐐💥👌🏾\\nHow about playing \"Fresh\" ???\\nLet\\'s get this W! Young Boyz gave it to us in H-Town got to match their intensity 4 quarters\\nIt\\'s GRIND TIME L.A! \"DUB\" is the word. Hustle, hustle hard, hustle harder! Don\\'t let up boyzzz!👑🏀💜💛\\nAD wins!\\nLet’s see if AD gives consistent performance on the court today . That’s how role player does. Know your role, and the rest will follow 💪\\nLebron make Cam Reddish more confident..trus\\nt is a big factor to be an inspired player.\\na superstar is lucky when he has good team mates that complement and understand their roles like jokic in denver\\nFound a way to stay on the court. I think he\\'ll be allowed to show his full game soon.\\nCam is very active on defense for the Lakers 💯🏀\\nImagine Vando and Cam on the same court 🔥🔥\\nreally great addition especially that Vando isn\\'t available yet\\nway to go young fella\\nI like the chemistry that is building with this group. No more trades. Let them play together.\\nThe game of cam reddish is a better fit for lebron and AD than Rui but Rui is much better all around player\\n🤔Darvin Ham did play on that Detroit team that was holding teams under 90 points he unlocked 🔓 Cam & Bron gave him confidence, the Hawks Knicks & Blazers only favored their stars thats why we never got to see the real Cam\\nMore interesting if Vando and Cam on the court together. Good job Cam✅\\nCam is the next Pippen or Green. Just doing the dirty work \\U0001faf6 great talent 🎉\\nCam could end up being our signing of the season if he continue to play like this\\nAlways wondered why he didnt get more playing time on his previous teams. Feel like they didnt really allow him to show what he can being given spot up minutes. Glad he found his way over to LA.\\nI knew he was gonna workout for us! Watched this kid since high school he’s been a beast! It’s just about finding that sweet spot of consistency! #LakersNation\\nCam has been playing well. Seems like he\\'s figured something out or is getting comfortable out there. Highest +/- on the team over last 7 games.\\nIf Reddish can & LBJ despite his age & still competing so the other players must follow, just don\\'t stand there and watch the ball.. be smart, physical & hustle.. if you can not make on the offense then defense.. your Team will be hard to beat and Championship goal is possible..\\nIf they get going again that\\'s someone who can slow down Booker & Murray in the playoffs. He\\'s young, energetic, long, tall, quick feet.\\nKeep up the good work Cam Reddish LET\\'S GO LA LAKERS\\nLakers will be a dawg in defense when Vando is back\\nLakers have a excellent Player Development Team.\\nIt doesn\\'t matter, at the end of the season when they lose on the first round of the playoffs, they gonna trade him as they do with Lonnie Walker IV.\\nPrime Trevor Ariza. Defense Specialist.\\n👏🏻🙌🏻big addition to the Lakers.\\nHim and vando gonna be great perimeter defense\\nlove his role in L.A and he undestand the role what the team needs\\nYoung Trevor Ariza 😤\\nKeep grinding CamRed💪\\nGnyn sana galwan dlo\\nCam and Vando on the court at the same time would be nightmare for the other team! 🔒 .

But their two consistently inconsistent, unathletic, non-defense playing, 1st year new- contracts even, should be gone quickly. Why they were resigned is another dumb Rob Polenski move.\\nKatherine Luna\\nDo this against a relevant team.

At 40 years old still the best in NBA.\\nI’d like to see AD play more at the 4 where he can be most dominant. Insert Hayes or wood next to him at 5. Prince will move to the bench when vando returns.\\nAt 38 LBJ is still dominating! Lakers Can’t keep expecting LBJ to play the entire season carrying the team\\nThe GOAT is still doing GOAT things in year 21 but it concerns me. Lakers depending on him to still carry this kind of load at this stage of his career.

I\\'m 2 years older than him and I ache walking up stairs.\\n\\nCan we not trade AD? He\\'s a great player, when he\\'s engaged and healthy. Those two things seem rare, it\\'s time to move on. We aren\\'t winning any chips like this, the other teams in the league are too good.\\nLebron can say what he wants. But AD is not and never will be an alpha.\\nC Woods, ten boards with ADs 14.

Defense wins the game for you 70% of the time\\nCam reddish and prince waaaw that 2 dog great defender and big heart…\\nLBJ is still the best 💪\\nGreat defense. AD already had 5 blocks after the first quarter, thinking he might accomplish a five by five.\\nDont mind this stat line for AD, would rather see an improvement in his D and low scoring than low scoring and low defensive stats.

Haha once again he gets away with traveling 😂 (second clip) steps with pivot foot 😆\\n\\nThe REAL GOATS (MJ & KOBE) didn\\'t have to cheat and ignore game fundamentals every game like LeBUM 🤣🤣🤣🤣\\nI KNOW WE DON\\'T KNOW EACH OTHER BUT TO EVERYONE WHO IS READING THIS NOW,I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN LIFE AND GOD BLESS YOU. 💗\\nStill has a long way to go to be at par with westbrook\\'s 211 career.\\nIt’s means nothin if he can’t translate them into rings. He’s no Kobe. Not even close to Jordan. He’s not a leader. He’s a follower.\\nlebron James 23 MVP this season gogo James for the win\\nWow! The GOAT is unstoppable!🔥💪\\nDon’t forget the sweeps and late game meltdowns\\nGotta love that right arm shoving prior to the dunk. Anyone else holds off a defender like that and it’s an offensive foul.\\nRemember it\\'s his 21\\'s season and he is still hot 🔥🔥🔥.\\nLeBron James\\nDefinitely the GOAT\\nSo what. Most NBA players can do what he does. What he can\\'t do is what Hordan and Kobe can do. Which is truly dominate the game without the help of the refs.\\nTriple Doubles are cool but they don\\'t guarantee a win, we want wins, not records or personal glory, just Team Wins Baby!\\nBefore he takes the 3 he travels changing pivot\\n1st player to score 39,000 points and eventually the 40,000 before the 2023-2024 season ends. 👍🏀🎶\\nHe should put both hands on the ball when he runs, it might help him from turnover 6k+ since the dope doesn\\'t have to dribble.\\nHow many years to reach that? Lol yall say goat? I guess if everyone stays in the league there entire life something is bound to happen. 🤣\\nAren’t most of these from after everyone quit playing defense ??\\n108 flops during the regular season. 48 flops during the few times they made playoffs.\\nLeBron James is on 🔥🔥🔥 at year 21 and still breaking records and milestones💯👑\\nAbsolutely King GOAT💛💜🔥💯👑\\nLeBron King James 🤴. I see you.\\nCrying time haters it\\'s crying time... 😂🤣😂🤣😂\\nHe has also missed over 14,000 shots. Second most in history. First is a laker too.\\nFouled and traveled, yet that\\'s somehow alright by today\\'s standards...\\nStats don’t win championship’s,\\njust to be written in sports books.\\nQuestion is, did the team won the game? it\\'s all Stat padding.\\nhonestl, they\\'re just tall...i dont see amy domination from these players smh\\nThe King is on 🔥\\nLet’s go Lakers 💛💜\\U0001faf6🏾🔥\\nBoy y’all are going to really be pissed if the Celtics win it all this season, y’all boy LeBron putting up all these longtivity stats in a Lakers uniform for the past going on 6th season and only got y’all a bubble championship, lol got to love it, himself is looking good for Lakers, bring on the stats, when I retire I’m going to be top 5 across the longtivity stat sheet, but only have a #1 spot the scoring title . Genuinely generous Shaq ❤️🏀\\nLove him !!\\nShaq has one of the biggest and most generous hearts ever.\\nShaq! Awes🏀me - sauce for the kids! 💜💛\\nShaq always was and always will be my favorite Laker of all time. 💜\\n🖤💜🤍💛\\nWay to go, Shaq! Love all the work you do!\\nShaq so gorgeous 😍\\n🙋\\u200d♂️ lemme go and hoop in that outdoor court\\n💜💛\\n❤️\\nShaq has never lost sight of giving back.\\nArmando Diaz\\nCan\\'t wait to see yha all 😍😍\\nShaqadelic ✌🏼\\nSuper Shaqtastic 💪🏼\\nThank you 😊 Shaq ❤️ your heart is in the right place.\\nDennis E.

Good job Los Angeles Lakers🔥🔥🔥🏀🏀🏀💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻\\nWe\\'re 2-0. ... And we didn\\'t even need penalty kicks.\\nEveryone saying we should focus on real championships, these games go towards making the playoffs. And as a Laker fan I always want more hardware.\\nHow bout we focus on the real tournament which is the NBA Finals!\\nTo everyone reading this Keep going. No matter how stuck you feel, no matter how bad things are right now, no matter how hopeless & depressed you feel, no matter how many days you have spent wishing things were different. I promise you won\\'t feel this way forever. Keep going.❤️🙏💯\\nGood luck 🤞 guys\\nGood Yo let\\'s go boys keep the good work\\nWould be cool to go against the Pacific Division so these tourneys can revive these rivalries.\\nIf we win it itll be another thankless accomplishment.\\nBecause everyone will claim they didn\\'t care about it and lebrons just front running again like they did in the bubble. I hate it here\\nDoes it count toward the regular season standings as well?\\nI don’t even know if I should watch after there last sry game😆\\nSo basically, this is for teams that can\\'t make it to the playoffs. So they give them tournament plays pretty good LO L. 🤣😂\\nThey gotta work on their ball movement , they\\'re just awful. I can imagine Ham and coaching staff doesn\\'t see this.\\nLakers win EVERYTHING, & haters just continue to hate , that’s how it goes\\nThese games are so more people watch nba games during November nd March lol\\nWe totally got a major problem on 1st quarter. Forcing our way to win by 1 or 10 from a large deficit is killing us and Bron minutes. Yes I love the win no doubt about it, but not the 1st quarter action. All the games they played beside Houston is all winable game if they fix that 1st quarter. I blamed the coach 1/2 not seeing it in the first couple minutes and straight them out and the other 1/2 is the starters.\\n\\nThis group can win game if not all the games if they fix that S%*T. Still believe in them!!! GO Lakers\\nOkay hard work is all we have to do to keep winning\\nJazz vs Lakers gonna be 🙌🔥\\nSo lebron will have 4.5 rings?\\nI see alot of negative feedback about the inseason tournament.... the games still counts towards regular season...\\nOnly trophy they can win this year\\nThe Jazz is silent but deadly too. Lets go Lakers and Jazz group A 💪\\nLet\\'s go Lakers! But truth be told I\\'m a little lost on this in season stuff😬\\nA win is a win! 😁\\nLet’s get this chip!! 🏅 😀\\nHow about their loss in Houston?\\n2 more wins and we are through??\\nGotta win tonight\\nwin it all\\nEasy bracket . Don’t let AD on the plane until he can make more then 4 layups and not miss. Come on bro. Consistency is what the team needs.\\nIf youll see this kind of players ,they are all tall or bigger than last season line up, but why darvin ham didnt use them to have big advantage on the paint not smallball play he\\'ll use everytime they had a game\\nLet’s go Lakers 💛💜🙌🏾🙏🏾\\U0001faf6🏾❤️\\nBest luck 💜💛💜💛\\nVando can play now!!!??\\nGood luck lakers\\nOK brothers, go get \\'em and win tonight! Let\\'s Go Lakers!!!\\nLet\\'s Go Lakers! 💜💛\\nGo for the win idol\\nBro I\\'m Tired of playing NBA2K with Lakers.

I BELIEVE!!!!! FAMILY!!!!!! SAFE TRAVELS!!!!!!, HAVE A GREAT GAME!!!!\\nI hope AD gets over his constant health issues and helps this team win.\\nThis is year Lakers you make champion 🏆\\n💜💜💜💛💛💛 Let\\'s go guys we need the WIN\\nKeep D’Lo 📍 . All around best game LeBron\\nThey play better and harder without LeBron ...\\nShow boater, that\\'s all he is interested in.\\nOne of the best sharpshooter the game have ever seen\\nDang Sacramento came to play. And Lakers got out hustled in the game. Another learning lesson. Can\\'t win them all. But you can learn from it. I believe this where some go lol. Get them next time. Go Lakers. 🏀💯\\nHow does AD only have 4 points at the half?\\n9 points for AD, what was he doing all game? Even Barnes got more than him\\nJames brown has more to break. I love you\\nYou can’t play all the field you only trying your best.\\nEvery Other Day-vis needs to find a way to be consistent for this team to work\\n\"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!!!LEBRON JAMES\" WAY TO GO!!!!! GOD\\'S CONTINUED BLESSINGS\"\\nWell if anyone has a career as long as him of course if Kobe kept playing and live he would’ve. Steph Curry could as well.\\nIMO if it isn’t done in the same time or less it doesn’t count. He could stay in league another 20 years until he owns all the records. Doesn’t make him the goat.\\nI think A.D needs to drink vitamins and carbohydrates because he is now a problem inside the court . He can secure rebound and he plays soft for today\\'s videos.\\nTrade him. Can easy get a good tarde on some upcoming young players.\\nLebron didn’t start with strong 3 point skill. He worked very hard to develop his long range shot. I can’t help but wonder what kind of player he would be without using the long shot so much.\\nNo offense but how many more attempts, no offense lebron is a great player but not the player make him out to be, he\\'s just played longer than most\\nYear 21 and he’s still beating Jason Terry 😂😂\\nI never get caught up in total of anything, especially when someone is playing longer than just about any other player ever.\\n\\nThat being said, he has played extremely well minus some hiccups for that long career now, which he should be proud of.\\n\\nI also don\\'t consider anyone to be the goat, it diminishes what came before, or after. Also with all the rule changes from the start of the NBA and changes that\\'ll happen in the future, it isn\\'t a fair title to give anyone.\\nDavis is flat and playing soft\\nYa right. Leads the NBA in missed 3 point attempts. Kobe was better\\n1st all time in turnovers.\\nNothing like watching the Lakers lose! Love it every time!\\nEverytime he breaks a record his team gets blown out. 🤣 🤣\\nTo bad they don\\'t have a good team around him. Nothing more than a .500 team Be lucky to even make the playoffs\\nAt this point, whatever LeBron does is a record I guess 😭\\n👑King LeBron James👑\\nAmericans like to act like numbers dont matter when it comes to Bron and Drake ... this gentleman is in Top 10 of almost everything in basketball 🐐\\nStats don\\'t guarantee championships.\\nAnthony Davis is going to pad his stats in the fourth quarter make seem like he had a real good game\\nDavis playing flat and playing soft settling for 3pts if we keep playing the way we playing we are going to lose this game sad but true. . Not really. They left all of their energy on the court last night against Memphis.\\na lot of turn over and missed 3 points better luck next time guys...\\nGood luck to the next 2 quarters take care the basketball 🏀 👍\\nNo fight and a sore in the eye\\nGreat job AD!! 62 mill and you score 9 pts. Amazing effort!! Got clowned by Sabonis who makes 1/3 of what you make.\\nAD 4 points Sabonis 18 points. Anybody know where AD is?\\nThe Lakers front office should all be fired\\nAd needs to grow up man.... The season is long and as a pro u have to be ready for games like this...\\nThe only actual player that is playing and making an effort is LeBron James\\nLooks like he’s getting a boost.\\nSeriously go through every game AD has played for the lakers with an Afro. You’ll want him to braid his hair again. Trust me!\\nThe number 3 is that Wood’s twins in white version?😂 Go Lakers💪💜💛\\n2 wins, 1 loss.... This team can\\'t go in a winning streak of more than 2 or 3!\\nOnly elite teams can handle it on the 2nd night of back to backs.\\nSabonis took ADs lunch in the first half\\nAD doesn’t feel like playing tonight\\nCome on guys let get it done!!!!\\nCam reddish did his best...and all ,they wanted to take it further but it was too late wangeamka 3rd maybe wangejaribu....\\nNext on the road trail blazers here we come,make sure you go grab that win\\nAustin reaves and Anthony Davis waaw what bad game I think davis is injury but reaves turnover after turnover this man cant play PG Vincent need to come back asap\\nReddish is improving! Keep it up!💪🏻\\n. . Battling, struggling and lost to the Kings! Ayayay! 🥴\\nSquad is getting out hustled on almost every play\\nLooks like he’s helping him jump up so he could dunk it\\nMJ...would have won this game easy!!! 😂😂😂\\nTerrible game they getting blown out\\nI HOPE THERE IS NO LOVE TELECAST FOR LAKERS ... IT WILL JUST BROKE THE HEART OF THE AUDIENCE AND FANS ..\\nPlaying sloppy!!\\nTerrible night, no energy, Kings killing from behind the arc 😪\\nWe need a rebounder ASAP\\nScore update? . Hopefully AD can score more than 9 pts consider he makes $62 mil a year\\nLebron just gave the ball up twice and didn\\'t even run back on defense he walked.... they need to get rid of him... terrible attitude all because you gave them the ball.... RUN BACK ON D\\nVamos Lakers, tenemos que voltear, sí se puede!\\nFrom blowing out to getting blown out. I can\\'t with this team. I\\'m going to bed.\\nIs this game not being shown on TV?\\nThere goes the 2 win streak! 😂\\nLet\\'s get the W tonight.\\nBirthday wish, Lakers dub! 💜💛\\nWhat time start game\\nGo lakers!🥰\\n🖤💛🤍💜\\nDavis playing flat and playing soft settling for 3pts if we keep playing the way we playing we are going to lose this game sad but true.\\nWho is the Lakers player?

Lakers are getting to the free throw line, which is good, but they are missing their free throws…which is not good. Portland is making their free throws…Lakers missing theirs. Free throw shooting to me, is a sign of how comfortable you are playing in the game…missing free throws means you are rattled…the defense is getting to you. You guys need to take a deep breath and calm yourselves…you are missing to many free throws. If you are getting to the free throw line, it means that you are rattling the defense, not the other way around. So need to be anxious out there. .

He’s looking good. I’d play him more if I were the Lakers. The kid is a baller\\nKid\\'s a grinder. Good on him!\\nHe deserve more time this young fella\\nThis is why it’s a better strategy to have 2 stars with 13 really good players over 3 Max salary players and struggling to round out the roster. Eight guys played last night, 7 in double figures. Made it pretty tough to double team AD last night. Still with 3 key contributors out. Rob Pelinka\\U0001fae1\\nGive him more time to play..Go max\\nDare I say, he seems a little bit young Kobe-ish when i see the highlights. Hope he keeps it up.\\nAlways my new kobe but afro version.\\nHis confidence and the fact that he clearly worked on his game really stands out.\\nThis team has good pieces… it’s still early… once we get rotations in place… and coach learns to lean on the hot hand… lakers will be ok… we don’t need to trade for another star player… if anything a natural center for defense and rebounds…take some of that loud off AD… we still got Vando out with an injury… he’ll be big for us on D too… cam wood AR Rui are playing good…\\ngood Game Max keep it up\\nMax at its max. He\\'s confident now.\\nI would too. I’ll show case my talent.\\nI’ve been telling this kid is special just the coach is blind.\\nMax showcasing his talent! Last year it was AR15, this year it\\'s Max\\'s turn. Great job coaching staff.\\nGive him a more minute to play\\nGood game max!! 💪🔥💪🔥\\ngood game\\nI have been said that Max is who the Lakers want Gabe to be!\\nHe’s a good defender too.\\nJust like horton-tucker, need some quality minutes to raise his value, hopefully some decent teams pick him up. Tho lakers might not let him for now\\nIf someone will be given their chance, they can show their worth...\\nI saw Kobe on Him..Lakers must give this guy more playing time..He\\'s a treasure someday!!\\nGiven more exposure he might turn out to be better than AR, not saying AR is bad\\nThese young guns should be given more times to develop their A games like those other teams are doing.\\nLebron was just chillin at this game.\\nIf the squad played this good consistently, then we would have a good chance. Let\\'s go lakers 🔥💯\\nHe guarded Mitchell at the last minute and it works. Good job young fella 👏\\nNo rookies played this time.for the lakers except for max Christie on his 2nd year. Is this the policy of the coaching mgt. They treat the rookies as waiting party\\nHope Jalen hood make his debut .\\nAll haters to the podium\\nGreat job young fella 💪 . CONGRATULATIONS👏 LAKERS!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!! TEAM WORK!!!!!! TEAM SPIRIT!!!!!!! TEAM RESPECT!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!!!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!!!!!\\n!! THAT\\'S WHAT I\\'M TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!\\n!\\nCongrats Laker\\'s good win..All played good esp.on the defense..\\nCongratulations\\n🎊 LAKERS good win tonight!!!\\nGood road win tonight. Imagine the possibilities with a 100% healthy roster? Hopefully sometimes early in the new year everyone will be healthy.\\ngood future all are contributing to the team, more chemistry needed\\nWow amazing. 7 players in double digits score. Congratulations\\nLos Angeles Lakers. Ret well for the next game.\\nKudos to #AR and #MAXCHRISTIE, played good defense and locked Spida in the 4th. 💜💛\\nThe early success the Lakers✨are having don’t surprise me. You have to give them time to play together and form some type of team chemistry. This team is good enough to win a lot of NBA games.\\nLakers guards deserve their flowers in this game. They played excellent defense specially in the 4th.\\nMax Christie was actually nice with it today🔥\\nI knew Christie was gonna step up this season, so far so good. Can\\'t wait to see how he\\'s gonna do during finals, hopefully 💛💜\\nLakers win is always a great feeling. Thank you.\\nThis was a gritty win. Let’s keep it rolling against Philly\\nNext game in Philadelphia 10 points , 0 in the 2nd half 😂😂😂 this is who AD is lol\\nwow 7 player in double figure\\nI think Austin at the 3 in certain instances makes alot of since. Dlo, Christie, Reaves, Lebron, AD is a interesting lineup none the least...\\nWe were very lazy tonight with the turnovers and the Lazy defense. A win is a win though! Game ball goes to Max 💪🔥\\nCongrats team Lakers💜💛👏👏👏😍\\nLakeshow!!!!🔥\\nCongrats lakers 💜💛\\nCongrats LakersNation 👏 💜🤍💛🖤\\nGood job guys, keep it up 👍\\n8 played, 7 in double figures! Great team win!\\nThe Davis/LBJ tandem has 9 pds and a great team win. Bravo to them. The King in control Mode.\\nGood team win. Everyone contributing feels good. AD on the mend 👍\\nTerrific win. When AD is the main focus, it makes a huge difference. Having Wood and Hayes on the floor more makes a huge difference also.\\nKudos to Coach DHam... even with just 8 players, he was able to make full use of them!!! The coach definitely have guts and knows what he\\'s doing playing Max Christie for 33 minutes (3rd to AD\\'s 38 mins. & LBJ\\'s 36 mins.)... it shows that it\\'s not only offense, that win games, but also great defense... ;)\\nI can see atleast 8steals and 7blocks.\\n\\nDefense is clicking when AD came to play. His consistency is always under question. Consistency is much more of a concern than his health lately.\\nLakers got better with the DEFENSIVE rebounding. Finished the game rebounding 73% of Cleveland\\'s misses, while Cleveland rebounded 70% of LA\\'s misses. And LA got the win. Going forward, defensive rebounding needs to be a point of emphasis...espe\\ncially against good shooting teams...you can\\'t be giving those teams second chances and expect to win.\\nReaves to the rescue cleaning up Lebron technical. It was a close game but we got em! . CONGRATULATIONS👏!!!!!!! TEAM WORK!!! TEAM SPIRIT!!!!! I GOT YOUR BACK!!!!!!!! I BELIEVE!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!!\\nFew mo wins and we up up n away…🚀\\nThe Lake Show\\nWe all know whats going to happen next game with AD. 11-9-1\\nReaves a beast on those last rebounds and took that hit on the floor like a champ.\\nLeBron was literally trying to give this game away SMH thank God it was Reaves that was taking the late game freethrows.\\n🙌 👏 I’m proud of Los Angeles Lakers\\nMad for the “shouldve won the game” from last game but i’m happy we got the W tonight. Can’t wait to see how the Lakers play against one of the top teams (Philly).\\nYes!!!!! Congratulations\\nLakers 💜💛💜💛💜💛👏\\nYesssss! It feels good Lakers!👑💜💛🏀\\nWow, how did that happen?\\nWe got the right AD tonight. Sloppy all game but still a great win!\\nLakers win is always a great feeling. Thank you.\\nLet’s go Lakers 🔥🔥🔥🦾🦾🦾THE TIME IS NOW WE GOING TO WIN EVERYTHING LBJ THE KING 🤴 THE GOAT 🐐 AD PUT SOME🦾🦾 THAT’S ALL WE NEED TO WIN EVERYTHING 🥇🏆\\nThey need to improve a lot to win every single game! Especially in 3-point shooting where LBJ kept on missing at the last minute!\\nAD needs to show up every game. So far he\\'s consistently inconsistent.\\nThat was an amazing game and a great comeback! Davis was on fire, Reaves was amazing in the last quarter and of course Lebron showed why he\\'s one of the best\\nawesome win ... the refs havee become predictable in the way they cheat the Lakers. 😢\\nThere was absolutely no defense in the first quarter Allowing 40 points.\\nThey beat the Cavs, my goodness with the star Power they have, they should be a undefeated, 🤦\\u200d♂️😂\\nPlease put Reeves back in the starting lineup\\nThey should try out Christie on every opposing teams primary scorer. He did good on Mitchell tonight\\nI hope ham will never use a small ball and Dlo must be benched in the 4th quarter\\nKudos to #MAXCHRISTIE and #AR! Played defense really well, locking up Spida. 💜💛\\nIf we get this AD every game we’ll be unstoppable\\nGreat win Lakeshow 💜💛\\nConsidering that DLo was the Cavs best player outstanding result.\\nA win is a win, will take it\\nLakers has a depth especially when vando and cam also rui\\nNice win! Bravo Reeves, Woods, Hayes, Christie & AD! Lakers 💜\\nAD actually played like he wanted to win tonight and Austin put in a solid game too little off night for bron but all in all it’s a dub🙌🏀 . Fabulous, magnificent, brilliant team players.\\nGreat game 👏👏👏 the bench was good👏👏\\nI absolutely live this in that, they haven\\'t forgotten where their blessings of talent, skills, basketball I,Q , health, success and longevity comes from\\nAlways be grateful, it helps to keep you humble.\\nLakers lost again big time..\\nWinning is mental. MJ has one of the strongest will to win, has the mental strength, has the killer instincts, and has the intelligence to figure out the way to win. LeBronze could only wish he had those because he is mentally weaker compared to MJ.\\nGreat players 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\\nGood luck\\nGood luck❤️❤️❤️\\nGood luck ❤️🎈💙\\nAll the best Lakeshow💜💛\\n\\nTope\\nGooood luck 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍\\nGood lucky!!! Lakers💜\\nThe last play was a good effort, but it lacked help. A good screenplay could have made it. You all have to make all your free throws count. You could have won the game, if you made all of them. Also, learn and use the glass whenever you\\'re on an angle or right below the rim. The glass is every ballers best friend.\\nYou do realize that once LeBron starts failing again, he will throw his teammates under the bus or make excuses to the media. It’s what he does it’s how he truly is.\\nCorrection I meant to say I absolutely love this instead of live this.\\nQueen James and his court\\nThe king praying to the king of kings Jesus ☝🏽\\U0001faf6🏽\\nI love brother hood but Davis can\\'t hold Cavs. That\\'s pitiful\\nI like when they pray before the game.\\nThat hairline gets better every year 😆\\nGood luck my Lakers\\nGo Do Work! 🤘🏾👊🏾🔥💯\\nPraying 🙏🏼changes things for better!

They still have time(20 seconds)... why not call for timeout to make some plays... it happened again... they never learned their lesson...and yet on 2.8 secs, they called for timeout...calli\\nng HAM\\nWe just fell short tonight due to some lapses on dying seconds. We should\\'ve won the game. Come on. Let\\'s bounce back next games.\\nWhat a disappointing loss, their coach should call a time out and make the right play. They still have 20 seconds to do that. Coach blunder 🤔\\nBack to back miscues from James probably cost them the game. Dang! And he was playing phenomenally up to that point too! Anyway backend of a back-to-back and minus Reddish and Vando, that was always almost a loss 😢😂\\nDavis Is soft only plays well against bad teams\\nIn the face of defeat,we find opportunity to improve and grow,fight lakers in the next game,\\nLet\\'s go purple and gold 💛💜💛💜💛💜👊👊👊👊\\nLove it. When they WIN, LEBRON IS GREAT AND THE REASON. When they LOSE LEBRON IS STILL GREAT AND NEVER THE REASON THEY LOST. HE NEVER HAS OR WILL TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY WHEN HIS TEAMS LOSE.\\nI\\'m telling you: if scores are tied Lechoke will take the Shot confidently because it\\'s just either WIN or OT but if an Opponent is leading then he will pass it because it\\'s either WIN OR LOSS, he has no guts in this case. If you\\'re watching his game then you know what I\\'m talking about.\\nY’all had it in the bag…and y’all choke 🤦🏽\\u200d♂️\\nThe best Coach for the Lakers is Phil Jackso. He needs to be back for the NBA season to win the NBA 2023 - 2024 championship title, because I was a little bit confuse about coach Darwin Ham coaching style. Hopefully, my suggestion will be accepted.\\nThe king is on fire 🔥\\nThe turnover King at it again. How come nobody keeps the stats of how many games players are responsible for losing? The missed free throws alone are horrendous…….\\nLots of great plays, with lots of bonehead plays....trying\\nbe the hero\\nOne of the best fourth quarters I\\'ve seen and then absolute garbage for the last 30 seconds.\\nI’m so disappointed at AD. How can he be so inconsistent especially on a game like this? They could have won this. Smh\\nWell no.excuss but they did play back to back games the other team was well rested. But they did make a big come back but just fell.short\\ngrats Dallas but thats a Great Game #Lakeshow\\nWE lose but WE Did a great match like WE Did in Miami 2 weeks ago 👏👏👏\\ncoach bat kc dika nag timeout😅\\nLebron shot a three pointer when he had Kyrie and pass the ball leads to turnover when he also had kyrie.🤦\\nWhen is AD goimg to become a consistant player, good game followed by 10 points..... not going to win another chip playing like that.\\nShot a 3 pointer when you’re up 2. What a wise decision 👏\\nAmd then Le Blow It throws a pass to Davis who\\'s under the basket but covered by two Maverick players... what was he thinking?\\nYup momentum LECHOKE😂🤣😂🤣!!! Last 3 possessions he CHOKED BIGTIME😂🤣😂!!!\\nImagine if they made those last 4 free throw shots……\\nLeBron should be out for the last minute each game\\nGuess this y’all last post of the night since Darvin chose to hold onto 2 timeouts when they were up with seconds to go. Acts like they’ll rollover to the next game when he could’ve used one to draw a play\\n\\nSame mistakes as last season 🤦\\u200d♂️\\nLeBron threw that game away !!! 😣😣😖￼\\nPass to AD under the basket.. 😭😭😭\\ndouble team on AD, why Bron did that \\U0001f979🤧😭😭😭😭 . LeBron messed up when they were poised for the win. Trying a hero 3 pointer and then throwing it away when he could have tried to drive for free throw chance or pass to someone open? Instead he tried a tough one to Davis and threw it all away. Great effort he played his part in the comeback attempt but that was poor end by Lebron\\nIf AD would actually play up to his talent the lakers would have been in a different position. AD just doesn’t have the heart, 10pts… come on dude\\nHappy Thanksgiving to everyone stay safe and stay positive. Let’s get it ￼\\nGood game\\nLechoke\\nDoesn’t matter, we lost. We can’t hang with the best teams in the league. It’s obvious we’re still not a good team.\\nGood game let’s go Lakers\\nThink the Lakers had turkey on their brain so they played like 💩\\nIt ought to be disappointing to fans come out and watch them and they casually playing when they should be attacking forcefully going for the killer shot. Kyrie took his 3 pt game Winner effortlessly\\nNo Laker used aggression, as they lose most games because they\\'re comfortable waiting for LeBron to be the 4th qrtr show, but it didn\\'t work this time huh?\\nBron missed his free throws, missed the hero 3, literally threw the ball away, and then missed another hero 3.\\n\\nGotta get that ball around better and more effectively\\nGood effort Lakers. The Mavericks are a great team. We only lost by 3 points not too shabby.\\n\\nHappy Thanksgiving 🎂\\nHappy Thanks Giving....Man, Lakers you\\'re the best Let\\'s just move to next game. WOW.. what i saw in the 4rd Quarter was so amazing. they lock mav down 30-13 run\\nDallas is one of the bad Defensive teams but the Lakers was worst last night!\\nMost of their games are like this, slow start, opponents will get a big lead, lakers will try to rally a comeback, then lakers will gas out and lose.\\nI was so sure Bron was gonna drive on that last possession and get fouled 💔 that comeback crazy\\nHappy 10 points Giving Anthony Davis\\nDavis did absolutely nothing to help with this come back. If he had maybe contributed atleast 2 or 3 buckets in the 4th quarter we could’ve won. Every shot he took was short.\\nGood Game L.A Lakers 💪💪🏆👏👑👑\\nOmg…heartbreaki\\nng..Lakers should’ve won after catching up last qrt still a great game🏀❤️🏀\\nLeBron threw that game away !!! 😣😣￼\\nso much for making the right play 🤣\\nUpdate score?\\nspettacolare.\\nLebron 😭🔥\\n92-95\\n💜🤍🖤💛\\n💜💛\\n💜🤍🖤💛\\nWhy blame LeBron for the lost when AD only had 10 points. When is AD going to step up and be Batman. Lebron has passed the torch to him, but he disappears in big games! AD doesn\\'t even want to be Robin. Lakers, please trade AD! 😡😡😡\\nCavs 76ers Pistons OKC and rockets .

They are so frustrating to watch now.\\nDon’t understand why AD is on the floor smiling when there losing 😡 absolutely no effort trying to rebound the basketball and just no defense whatsoever, Lakers are way better then this Mavs!!!!! #FireHam\\nThe Lakers are just asking to much from James. I don’t see him making it the whole season. If he gets hurt it’s over. Take him away, who will score, who will rebound and who will handle the ball. It’s a matter of time before this season is over and the Lakers force James into a early retirement. Then the Lakers will be unwatchable…\\nMy lakers performing good this year ...Las Angeles Lakers fo life .🏀💪\\nYup we about to blown out again 😏\\nThis game is a wrap.

LAKERS FANS!!!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!\\nLakers played their best game of the season, the whole team was great\\nMascot Person, Really?😂\\nThe KING THE GOAT\\nLEBRON JAMES,💪💪💪💪\\n\\nNO DEBATE\\nLeBron James is the GOAT 🐐\\nTHE GOAT AND IF YOU DON\\'T AGREE WITH MY OPINION TOO BAD IT\\'S MINE ‼️💜💛 🔥🔥🔥💪\\nAs a Laker fan, I think Lebron is playing his best as a Laker this season. In the previous seasons, I often found myself disheartened witnessing LeBron making questionable decisions, such as persistently attempting three-pointers despite missing many and displaying hesitancy to drive to the basket, instead settling for difficult fadeaway jumpers from the perimeter. His reluctance to exploit his unstoppable penetration capabilities was perplexing.\\n\\nHowever, this season has seen a remarkable transformation.\\nLeBron\\'s shooting percentage has soared significantly, attributed to his strategic shift towards opting for higher-percenta\\nge shots and abandoning the tendency to force three-pointers.\\nHe has become notably more efficient and, without a doubt, more lethal on the court than ever before.\\n6 wins over the last 7 games. I\\'ll take it!\\ngood job! 💪🏾👑💜💛\\nLebron James 😊🥂❤\\nThe real goat is mj\\nPeople who do this for Leflop, messi, etc definitely don\\'t watch alot of sports.\\n\\nHonesty kobe is the best.\\n\\nWay better then LeBron.\\n\\nThese \"fans\" are out of control.\\nSo great, even great at leading the all time record for turnovers at a whopping 5k.

YES!!!!! A BROTHERHOOD AND RESPECT STATEMENT!!!! REAL!!!!! REAL FRIENDSHIP!!!!!\\nI BELIEVE!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!!\\n38 is just a number.\\nStill King 👑 James the best player\\nLast night showed that the team can do whatever they want. Guy keep this spirit,but better decisions.\\nI won\\'t say I\\'m happy but I\\'m optimistic\\nabout there future. There plan at the end of these games has gotten better. We need to break through that system of letting it be a two option decision on the closer at that point every body on the team is your closer . Let the younger stars emerge when we get Vanderbilt back a added defender it\\'s going to make a big difference 💯 family ✌️.\\nAD did it again. We needed him last night and this dude scores 10 points 😡😡 Ridiculous!!\\nGreat words then AD plays like he is 38 geez, softer than pudding.\\nAge is ONLY a number. It is all about how you take care of yourself, preventing injuries, and what kind of injury history you have had of course. Many many slow down due to injury history causing their joints to slow them down and not be as explosive and consistent like they use to. Klay Thompson is a big example of this. There are also many who start losing interest in their 30s causing less aggressiveness and more laziness and then they try to hide their interest so they can still get paid. James loves basketball and he has more motivation than ever now. With his age though, he does have to work harder to keep playing at the level he is playing at. Motivation, interest, consistency is key.\\nGO LA..GO LA💛💜🥳🥳\\nGreat players 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\\nYES LeBron is Enjoying his games.You can see it whilst he\\'s on d court.So Energetic.\\nReading d game ..Has a really high IQ when it comes to making decisions n controlling what happens on d court.Le Goat.Go get that trophy.\\nLeBron, I know it’s not new to you, but the fans in the media are excited you know the outcome and I’ll start to playoffs\\nShouldn\\'t that make you work harder,but it doesn\\'t, Lakers are wasting their money on AD. Only reason I think they are keeping him is because of LeBron, once LeBron leaves I would package him up out of there.\\nThat\\'s awesome to hear! It sounds like LeBron James is in incredible form. It\\'s impressive how he\\'s performing at such a high level, even at 38 years old. He\\'s definitely a force to be reckoned with on the court! 🏀🔥\\nLakers are pathetic. They must be given more free throws than all the other teams for them to win.\\nLet\\'s win the championship.\\nIf AD played like he should every game, we wouldn\\'t even need Lebron\\nGo Lakers, 🏀🏆\\nI bought those purple rain LeBron shoes. Love them.\\nAD 10 points wasn\\'t why the Lakers loss last night it was an ill responsible 3 point shot taking when you have a 2 point lead instead of driving to the basket for a layup or foul or take a time out to set up a play,then throw the ball in double coverage on AD come on man LeBron been in league to long to be still making them mistakes and bad decisions no excuses for someone who been in the league long as he has\\nGlad he stopped admiring the Joker enough to praise his own teammate. Needs killer instinct.\\nBron is having fun and davis is not having fun the guy is in prime play like it ,play some defense\\nHow can u be this good at 38 it’s insane. As a lakers fan you might not like this but I think mj is the goat but I think lebron is second and definitely the best ever old player.\\nDon\\'t mean anything...they\\ncan\\'t beat the good teams bad sign when playoffs start...😂😂😂\\nI know Bron is Bron but I feel like the reason AD falls off offensively sometimes is cuz he knows he has lebron vs in Nola when he was the guy🤔\\nthe prediction is lakers will fall again in the playoffs or sweep again by the nuggets or clippers\\nAD playing like he 38\\nPround of you Lebron James .

Absolutely the right play. LeBron saw Brooks doubling down on him. Those who said LeBron trusted AR more than him don\\'t understand basketball.\\nLebron is actually training these young talents differently. Confidence, take the moment, no second thought, come what may, trust, clutch. Lebron is lifting his teammates, not scared to be bashed for his decisions.\\nIt’s nice to see Austin Reaves buzzer beater 🔥🥰\\nTHANK YOU🙏 AUSTIN REAVES!!!!FOR THE WIN!!!! THANK YOU🙏 KING JAMES FOR BELIEVING IN HIM!!!! THAT\\'S WHAT I CALL TEAM WORK !!!!TRUST!!! AND RESPECT AT IT\\'S BEST!!!! I BELIEVE!!!! I BELIEVE!!!! I BELIEVE!!!!\\nAustin Reaves! AR! Always Reliable when the team needs his shots. Whew 👏👏👏\\nGreat pass and great shot!\\nLebron and AR holding the ball and dribbling too long with the shot clock winding down. This often leads to a low percentage shot or a pass to a teammate with little or no time left on the shot clock. Need to get into offensive set sooner, run pick and roll, have more cutting and movement off the ball.\\nAR is a winner. Looked harried and hesitant at times. Other players wouldn\\'t have been able to step up. Lebron continues to amaze.\\nSo happy for him! Hated that everyone just called him overrated for no reason. He\\'s still HIM!\\nThis kid is something special, please dont let him go!\\nGive more chance throw trepoints for Austin Reeves\\nReaves, he’s becoming a superstar baby\\nAustin Reaves the legend 👏👏👏\\nI lab it...😍😍💜💛🔥💪🍻yahooo\\nLove him💛💜💛💜\\nI don’t know. Seems to me they took a long time to get to that point. I think it makes more sense to move around without the ball so you can get a better look instead of just holding it out there and running the shot clock down and having to take a 31-foot jumpshot. ￼￼\\nCurry really did ruin the game! Shooting as far out as possible for a 3 pointer is not more points. 3pts is 3pts lol. Now everybody thinks somehow this is good basketball shooting a super deep 3 . I think you could have better shot selection here Lebron!\\nHighest basketball.IQ ever...\\nSaw the double coming ..knew right away someone is wide open.. trusting his teammates can knock down the shot\\nY\\'all ballhog idols dont have that IQ..never\\nMJ would have taken the shot, LeBron always dishes it off.. this is why LeBron will never be the Goat\\nGreat shot! Love Reeves. Please stop this ice in vein. It’s old.\\nThat was insane, I remember halfway through that shot, I stopped watching, took a break and responded to a few emails, when I came back the ball hit the basket and it was 3pts 🥵🥵\\nBron doing the right play in every single night ,,\\n\\n#trustyourteamma\\ntes\\nthis dude reminds me of danny ainge\\nThe fact that Lebron trusts him to take a high-leverage shot late in the game is all anyone needs to know.\\nKnow say notting why lebron pass the ball? Owwwwww becuase Reaves knock down the shot!\\nAR-15 shot that 3 all the way from Austin, TX.\\nHis jumper is almost identical to a old player I can\\'t remember.\\nAustin Powers.. 😘💜💛\\nIf reaves miss that shot ppl would be hating on lebron for not taking it\\nLeBron is different\\nThe wey he trust his teammates it\\'s CRAZY yow 🔥🦁\\n\"You\\'re him\" Austin💪AR-15🏀 .

The GOAT 🐐👑\\nReaves too did a great job today 🔥💛💜\\nYou know what’s messed up? The fact that you got people hating him for passing to a wide open player for the last shot while he’s being doubled team. They come out of the woods if the player misses the shot but if he makes the shot they get quiet.\\nBron was out of his mind . What a game for him\\nAnother ring with Lakers as well as MVP.Still carrying these youngsters on his broad shoulders.Come on guys.Time to put in some work.This is not acceptable.You are a young team ..train harder n allow LeBron to breathe..He\\'s 38 not 18.Time to hit those buckets.Dont want him getting burnt out when he is needed for the playoffs.\\nBreaking News: A group of 14 young men have been found guilty of elder abuse, as they have been relying on an old man to carry them, and have been giving zero help to the victim.\\nIt\\'s a long season, I hope he paces himself strategically.\\nMan , for at that effort that this older great player is putting in his game. Mr. LeBron James ; it would be fantastic to see him getting another Ring with the Lakers before he retires 🙏💜💛\\nI already heard he had to get a tetanus shot because of all the scratches he got from Dillon Brooks 💯\\nWhile this is amazing let’s keep it a buck. Bron at 39 (almost) should not have to put up 30+ to beat the rockets by 1\\nMVP worthy Performance.\\nThe caption should be how he do that? With the guy looking amazed 😂😂\\nTake your time BRO King James,its a long way to go take your time.\\nCongrat\\'s Laker\\'s very.nice game Congrats Lebron amd all Laker\\'s team\\nAll haters to the podium\\nLeBron really sending us all to the hospital with that first missed FT! 😂😂\\nLebron is a Cyborg\\nBron putting on a clinic‼️💜💛\\nStill Bulldozing it\\'s way @ age 38\\nGreatness performing great!!!\\nHow sad that none of the other guys can play like this guy they should be in the G-league\\nIt\\'s crazy that Lebron is still carrying the Lakers at this point in his career.\\n21 season.

The best player of all time.🐐🐐🐐💪🔥💜💛🏆👑\\nYou ever notice how no matter what LeBron does people filter it through their own narratives. Like just because he\\'s still playing, and breaking records, they automatically assume he\\'s only playing to break records. Because of course he couldn\\'t possibly be playing because he loves the game, and can still perform at a high level. Just because he\\'s breaking records we automatically have to assume that\\'s his primary motivation.\\nCongratulations\\n! King James\\nThe man can do it all 🐐\\nIt took him 7 years longer, but hey good job\\nStealing All star players to be his team mates 😂\\nWhen he retired at 49 lol he gave 50k points 15k assist and rebounds lol and still 4 rings\\nAll time Scorer - not the 1, not 2 Scoring Titles, not even the greatest scoring average in playoffs or finals\\n8th All time Steals - not 1 Defensive player\\nLebum James still Chasing individual record awards, remember that he is playing now for 21 years season....its a complaiments🤣\\nWhen 🐍 was hitting milestones, a certain fan base loved to claim they were just longevity feats and don’t mean much. I guess times have changed.\\nCongratulations\\nLeBron!\\nHe rather be 6-0 in da finals!!! 😂😂😂😂\\nIf MJ played as many games he\\'d be number 1 in total steals and number 4 in steals per game\\nPlease get to 1st so my signed jersey in storage is worth more! Blue Lives Matter Le Bron!!! Dunbass.\\nCongratulations\\nhaters, I hope this will make you happy 🤣🤣😜😜👑💛💜💪\\nBut he don’t play defense they say.\\nI guess the other team just threw him the ball intentionally.\\nLebron is a lockdown defender. Just ask Derrick Rose in that playoff series what happened when GOAT James picked him up.\\nWhere does he fall on the all-time list for turnovers?\\nSo many yrs…. Yet will never touch John Stockton…. My boy stock deserves so much more recognition\\nSad that he has to hang around the league for years to try and break.records people who where actually great set in shorter period of time\\nat some point we should consider stopping Congrats due to the number of more years he\\'s played?\\nHater continues to be hating and watch God blessings\\nBreaking records is what will open eyes, not how many years it took Lebron to break them. The result is the real stat.\\nNext week! Leflop passes the last customer in sitting in every seat in every arena!!\\ncongrats lbj...best all around player...\\nCongrats .It is not easy achievement.It is more difficult because he is tall guy\\nCongrats LBJ👑🙌🏽🐐🏀💞\\nCongratulations\\nLBJ 🙏🏾🙌🏾👏🏾💜💛\\U0001faf6🏾🔥❤️\\nDid he steal a win though.

Don\\'t let up boyzzz!👑🏀💜💛\\nAD wins!\\nLet’s see if AD gives consistent performance on the court today . That’s how role player does. Know your role, and the rest will follow 💪\\nLebron make Cam Reddish more confident..trus\\nt is a big factor to be an inspired player.\\na superstar is lucky when he has good team mates that complement and understand their roles like jokic in denver\\nFound a way to stay on the court. I think he\\'ll be allowed to show his full game soon.\\nCam is very active on defense for the Lakers 💯🏀\\nImagine Vando and Cam on the same court 🔥🔥\\nreally great addition especially that Vando isn\\'t available yet\\nway to go young fella\\nI like the chemistry that is building with this group. No more trades. Let them play together.\\nThe game of cam reddish is a better fit for lebron and AD than Rui but Rui is much better all around player\\n🤔Darvin Ham did play on that Detroit team that was holding teams under 90 points he unlocked 🔓 Cam & Bron gave him confidence, the Hawks Knicks & Blazers only favored their stars thats why we never got to see the real Cam\\nMore interesting if Vando and Cam on the court together. Good job Cam✅\\nCam is the next Pippen or Green. Just doing the dirty work \\U0001faf6 great talent 🎉\\nCam could end up being our signing of the season if he continue to play like this\\nAlways wondered why he didnt get more playing time on his previous teams. Feel like they didnt really allow him to show what he can being given spot up minutes. Glad he found his way over to LA.\\nI knew he was gonna workout for us! Watched this kid since high school he’s been a beast! It’s just about finding that sweet spot of consistency! #LakersNation\\nCam has been playing well. Seems like he\\'s figured something out or is getting comfortable out there. Highest +/- on the team over last 7 games.\\nIf Reddish can & LBJ despite his age & still competing so the other players must follow, just don\\'t stand there and watch the ball.. be smart, physical & hustle.. if you can not make on the offense then defense.. your Team will be hard to beat and Championship goal is possible..\\nIf they get going again that\\'s someone who can slow down Booker & Murray in the playoffs. He\\'s young, energetic, long, tall, quick feet.\\nKeep up the good work Cam Reddish LET\\'S GO LA LAKERS\\nLakers will be a dawg in defense when Vando is back\\nLakers have a excellent Player Development Team.\\nIt doesn\\'t matter, at the end of the season when they lose on the first round of the playoffs, they gonna trade him as they do with Lonnie Walker IV.\\nPrime Trevor Ariza. Defense Specialist.\\n👏🏻🙌🏻big addition to the Lakers.\\nHim and vando gonna be great perimeter defense\\nlove his role in L.A and he undestand the role what the team needs\\nYoung Trevor Ariza 😤\\nKeep grinding CamRed💪\\nGnyn sana galwan dlo\\nCam and Vando on the court at the same time would be nightmare for the other team! 🔒 . To everyone reading this Keep going. No matter how stuck you feel, no matter how bad things are right now, no matter how hopeless & depressed you feel, no matter how many days you have spent wishing things were different. I promise you won\\'t feel this way forever.

But their two consistently inconsistent, unathletic, non-defense playing, 1st year new- contracts even, should be gone quickly. Why they were resigned is another dumb Rob Polenski move.\\nKatherine Luna\\nDo this against a relevant team. Do this against Sacramento, healthy, experienced, Dallas, Phoenix, GSW, Boston, Milwaukee,\\nPhiladelphia, Miami, Cleveland.

At 40 years old still the best in NBA.\\nI’d like to see AD play more at the 4 where he can be most dominant. Insert Hayes or wood next to him at 5. Prince will move to the bench when vando returns.\\nAt 38 LBJ is still dominating! Lakers Can’t keep expecting LBJ to play the entire season carrying the team\\nThe GOAT is still doing GOAT things in year 21 but it concerns me. Lakers depending on him to still carry this kind of load at this stage of his career.

I\\'m 2 years older than him and I ache walking up stairs.\\n\\nCan we not trade AD? He\\'s a great player, when he\\'s engaged and healthy. Those two things seem rare, it\\'s time to move on. We aren\\'t winning any chips like this, the other teams in the league are too good.\\nLebron can say what he wants. But AD is not and never will be an alpha.\\nC Woods, ten boards with ADs 14.

No NBA player ever did this way back. LeBron James from day one of his career up to now is still dominating. Amazing talent!💪👏💞\\nLebron is still the man, but there will not be another championship if AD doesn’t start playing like a real star. Lebron can’t do it alone\\nA 38 year old man, and still the highest scorer on the team is insane appreciate the greatness!\\nEverybody complaining about AD numbers clearly don’t know that blocks stop the opponents from scoring and limit their winning ! Defense wins the game for you 70% of the time\\nCam reddish and prince waaaw that 2 dog great defender and big heart…\\nLBJ is still the best 💪\\nGreat defense. AD already had 5 blocks after the first quarter, thinking he might accomplish a five by five.\\nDont mind this stat line for AD, would rather see an improvement in his D and low scoring than low scoring and low defensive stats. If ya not on that not and not scoring, step it up on D and hustle else where.\\nLove it if we just’ kepp working on REB we will keep winning.\\nfor a second i thought they were holding hands skipping . 👑🐐💜💛\\nPicture of a thousand words! 38 years old, 20 years in a league, and still demands that much attention on the court. 👑\\nBron will reach 40k points this season & if he wins another ring with this laker team - then the GOAT debate is over 👑\\nto much defense but others dont appreaciate his greatness\\n💛💜💪\\nHe is the King, he is the.Goat... no despute about it !\\nYes Jordan has more rings and no lost in finals but You have to appreciate the heart this man gives in this different era of basketball game today.\\nHe\\'s Unstoppable!💪🏀 Hold It Down!!\\nHaters still goona hate but honestly still dropping 35 point at his age hes the true goat\\nThey cant stop the king 👑\\nI was at that game last night….

Keep pushing and balling!!!!!🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀👏👏👏👏👏\\nWow he beat a lottery team...\\nAnd God willing more victories . Congratulations\\nto you .\\nLakers keep on winning in the in-season tournament n I like it\\nHooray to the winning team lakers 💜💛💜💛👊👊💪💪💪\\nThe last 5 mins in the 4th the Lakers were cruising & once AD checked in immediately the Blazers made a push. I hope they start holding AD accountable\\nYeahhhhh ..yahooo congrats team Lakers ..🎶🍻💪💜💛LBJ is on 🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪🏀❤️\\nBron has been on point this season with consistency. Hopefully, that will rub off on AD.\\nGood team play\\nOhh mama there goes LeBron James 👑🐐\\nwhat a great game for Los Angeles Lakers\\n💪💪💪💪💪\\nUgh oh. A new stat o my lebron has ever accomplished … here we go lol\\nThat\\'s until they play some one actually good in the tournament 🤦\\nI know Cam didn\\'t score a lot of points tonight, but the game ball today goes to him. Man was everywhere on defense.\\nat 38 he still carries this team it\\'s really not normal. davis and reaves need to wake up because they\\'re the next generation. lebron is so special that we have to save him for the big deadlines. bravo for this victory\\nAD - Always Disappointing 😭\\nAs cool as it is to see Bron turn back time, this isn\\'t sustainable. They need to give him more rest and help. He can\\'t keep scoring 30+ to keep them in the game.\\nThe most consistent lakers player ever LBJ 💯💯\\nCam Reddish, ladies and gentlemen.\\nHope we play like this consistently against high caliber teams. Let\\'s go! 🙂\\nA 38 year old man, and still the highest scorer on the team is insane appreciate the greatness!\\nDon\\'t let this distract you from the fact that James Harden just scored 24 points in his first win of the season!\\nmight as well all remaining games are in season tournament! Lol\\nWe need some real season wins though\\nDarwin is now listening and has stopped playing Ar & DLo at the same time 😌\\nCongratulations\\nLakers 🏀🏆\\nCongratulations\\nLeBron James 🏆🏀\\nFeels good to be undefeated in high stakes games 😎 3-0 let’s make it 4 Tuesday night fellas . Beautiful shot by Lebron James !!!👑🐐\\n🔥🔥🔥💯\\nLeBron doin\\' his work just like Kobe 👍! The Purple and Gold posse are headed home to beat the Rockets 🚀 😴.\\nLeBron benefits from the hustle of his teammates.\\nThat was a true hustle and made it. 👏🏽👏🏽😇\\nIt’s always Bron for me!!!! Let’s gooo!!! 💜💛\\nExtra effort!!!!💪🏾\\ngoodluck for tomorrows game Lakers #LakersNation #LakersWin #LakeShow LeBron James 💪💪💪\\nStaring lineup could be AD, Bron, Cam, Wood and Prince. More importantly the zone defense we ran is perfect and is forcing the team to communicate on defense while being in better position to grab rebounds. 🔥\\nFor the greatest basketball player ever. Dude sure misses alot of layups\\nJames layup didn\\'t even hit the rim. But that is okay I am sure.\\nPeople getting stabbed in LeBron have his way he’s just doing what do you want to do? Yo let them get you through their sublet new have his way he won’t be going on those boards put some different Sony. Yeah I like you’re scared of me.\\nAnd hustles could bring victory 😊\\nWhat the haters at...yall quiet\\nAll haters to the podium!\\nMissed layup and teammates tipping made it happen. LeBron is done\\nNow that’s hustling\\nRight, sometimes they start games hustling and then after a couple of wins they come out with swag like they are the Harlem Globetrotters 😢\\nRui,reddish prince they always consistence in their game\\nGotta love Prince. He’s got guts\\n👑King LeBron James👑\\nThe greatest 👑\\nGo Lakers Go\\nLolobron 👑 🐐\\nThis is perfection\\nYessir (7x)\\nLEBRON JAM3S 🎯\\nit IS easy for him\\nreddish did good job in this game...👍\\nCONGRATULATIONS👏 LAKERS!!!! THANK YOU🙏 KING JAMES!!!!!!! . 🙏🏾👑🐐\\nWin or lose, Injured or healthy, LeBron will always be light years better than Jordan. Jordan would be Al-Farouq Aminu level without Rodman and Pippen’s help and Phil Jackson’s coaching.\\n\\nAll other arguments are considered dumb and large volume cap 🧢\\n\\nIt is what it is. End of the freaking story! 🤴🐐🔥\\nThe greatest ever\\nJordan, will always be number one in my heart, no one can top that.\\nIn the nba there are many talented players who are called superstars but Lebron is the only superstar who lasted 21 seasons in the same level...That\\'s the reason I will call him the greatest of all greats.\\nThe best ever to play the game\\nLakers need to learn how to move without the ball. They\\'re Just standing around like statues\\nthey win for no. 7 spot 😂\\nMy only one idol 👑 James the 🐐 🐐\\nThe King is always on Fire🔥🔥🔥🔥\\nLebron looked smooth last night.\\nToo bad he jumps ship\\n⚡💪🏿😤💯🦁👑🐐🏆🐻💵23!💥\\nthe goat is back welcome lakers for the championship like a greatest in NBA in history\\nGreat win tonight Lakers way to go 💛💜💛💜\\nGotta love Prince. He’s got guts\\nFire in 3 FREEZE 💦💪🌟🏀💜💛\\nThen ham took him out😂\\nYessir🥳\\nscore update??\\nHandsome legend 🔥😎💜💛\\nHappy weekend Harold Martin Ian\\n💛 🔥\\n💜💛\\n💛🔥\\nCONGRATULATIONS👏 LAKERS!!!!! THANK YOU🙏 KING JAMES!!!!!!!\\nThat’s a bad man!!!!! 😮\\u200d💨👑🐐\\nThe best ❤️❤️❤️\\n🐐\\nIn this advanced network era. The fact that LeBron James doesn\\'t have a single scandal, that he\\'s disciplined, that he\\'s not a normal person, that\\'s one of the things I love about him. . To everyone reading this Keep going. No matter how stuck you feel, no matter how bad things are right now, no matter how hopeless & depressed you feel, no matter how many days you have spent wishing things were different. I promise you won\\'t feel this way forever. Keep going.❤️🙏💯\\nVery, very poor defense\\n👊👊💜💛💜\\nHow can they win the game if they don\\'t fire Ham. He benched Wood who plays well while AD is struggling. Dlo is a ball hogger indeed, and AR is out of his rythmn consistently. Lakers should make a serious move for Lavine.\\nThat dude is in need of a mental health day 💯\\nHam is a mediocre coach. No sense of urgency when things are not working. He has this team last year and still doesn\\'t know how to shuffle his players. He always says that he is a defense coach, but it doesn\\'t reflects on how they play.\\nRip City 😂\\nAnd just like that AD has 2 points. Sound the alarm 😂😂😂😂😂. Things that get LA hype are so funny!\\nWe need a new team 😜😜😜 this currently lakers sucks the only one that put strong power is Lebron and that’s all, if the Chicago bulls wants all the lakers for lavine and Caruso it’s ok 🤣🤣🤣\\nAd is soft... We need someone who feel passion for purple and gold... Ad it\\'s over...\\nPoor Defense, not a contender 🎯\\nSolo ganan a equipos chicos, ahí Davis es feliz y se siente fuerte 🤣\\n6-7 over Portland 🤗\\nAD won the bubble ship and switched up…if you know you know\\nA whole body of insecurities\\nLet’s go Lakers 💛💜🙏🏾🙌🏾\\nLest Goo Lakers 💛💜👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼\\n💛🤍💜🖤\\nOk they beating the Blazers 😂\\nWell done boys!!!\\nBig win coming 🏀🏀🏀💪\\nstart cooking\\n6-7 over Portland 🤗\\nPoor defense\\nAD LANG SAKALAM 💪\\nGood luck lakers\\n🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽\\n💜💛\\n💜💛\\n💪🏽 .

I think they\\'ll win😂\\nGood Luck Squad.\\nMay laro b lakrrs ngaun . Haha once again he gets away with traveling 😂 (second clip) steps with pivot foot 😆\\n\\nThe REAL GOATS (MJ & KOBE) didn\\'t have to cheat and ignore game fundamentals every game like LeBUM 🤣🤣🤣🤣\\nI KNOW WE DON\\'T KNOW EACH OTHER BUT TO EVERYONE WHO IS READING THIS NOW,I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN LIFE AND GOD BLESS YOU. 💗\\nStill has a long way to go to be at par with westbrook\\'s 211 career.\\nIt’s means nothin if he can’t translate them into rings. He’s no Kobe. Not even close to Jordan. He’s not a leader. He’s a follower.\\nlebron James 23 MVP this season gogo James for the win\\nWow! The GOAT is unstoppable!🔥💪\\nDon’t forget the sweeps and late game meltdowns\\nGotta love that right arm shoving prior to the dunk. Anyone else holds off a defender like that and it’s an offensive foul.\\nRemember it\\'s his 21\\'s season and he is still hot 🔥🔥🔥.\\nLeBron James\\nDefinitely the GOAT\\nSo what. Most NBA players can do what he does. What he can\\'t do is what Hordan and Kobe can do. Which is truly dominate the game without the help of the refs.\\nTriple Doubles are cool but they don\\'t guarantee a win, we want wins, not records or personal glory, just Team Wins Baby!\\nBefore he takes the 3 he travels changing pivot\\n1st player to score 39,000 points and eventually the 40,000 before the 2023-2024 season ends. 👍🏀🎶\\nHe should put both hands on the ball when he runs, it might help him from turnover 6k+ since the dope doesn\\'t have to dribble.\\nHow many years to reach that? Lol yall say goat? I guess if everyone stays in the league there entire life something is bound to happen. 🤣\\nAren’t most of these from after everyone quit playing defense ??\\n108 flops during the regular season. 48 flops during the few times they made playoffs.\\nLeBron James is on 🔥🔥🔥 at year 21 and still breaking records and milestones💯👑\\nAbsolutely King GOAT💛💜🔥💯👑\\nLeBron King James 🤴. I see you.\\nCrying time haters it\\'s crying time... 😂🤣😂🤣😂\\nHe has also missed over 14,000 shots. Second most in history. First is a laker too.\\nFouled and traveled, yet that\\'s somehow alright by today\\'s standards...\\nStats don’t win championship’s,\\njust to be written in sports books.\\nQuestion is, did the team won the game? it\\'s all Stat padding.\\nhonestl, they\\'re just tall...i dont see amy domination from these players smh\\nThe King is on 🔥\\nLet’s go Lakers 💛💜\\U0001faf6🏾🔥\\nBoy y’all are going to really be pissed if the Celtics win it all this season, y’all boy LeBron putting up all these longtivity stats in a Lakers uniform for the past going on 6th season and only got y’all a bubble championship, lol got to love it, himself is looking good for Lakers, bring on the stats, when I retire I’m going to be top 5 across the longtivity stat sheet, but only have a #1 spot the scoring title . Genuinely generous Shaq ❤️🏀\\nLove him !!\\nShaq has one of the biggest and most generous hearts ever.\\nShaq!

Good job Los Angeles Lakers🔥🔥🔥🏀🏀🏀💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻\\nWe\\'re 2-0. ... And we didn\\'t even need penalty kicks.\\nEveryone saying we should focus on real championships, these games go towards making the playoffs. And as a Laker fan I always want more hardware.\\nHow bout we focus on the real tournament which is the NBA Finals!\\nTo everyone reading this Keep going. No matter how stuck you feel, no matter how bad things are right now, no matter how hopeless & depressed you feel, no matter how many days you have spent wishing things were different. I promise you won\\'t feel this way forever. Keep going.❤️🙏💯\\nGood luck 🤞 guys\\nGood Yo let\\'s go boys keep the good work\\nWould be cool to go against the Pacific Division so these tourneys can revive these rivalries.\\nIf we win it itll be another thankless accomplishment.\\nBecause everyone will claim they didn\\'t care about it and lebrons just front running again like they did in the bubble. I hate it here\\nDoes it count toward the regular season standings as well?\\nI don’t even know if I should watch after there last sry game😆\\nSo basically, this is for teams that can\\'t make it to the playoffs. So they give them tournament plays pretty good LO L. 🤣😂\\nThey gotta work on their ball movement , they\\'re just awful. I can imagine Ham and coaching staff doesn\\'t see this.\\nLakers win EVERYTHING, & haters just continue to hate , that’s how it goes\\nThese games are so more people watch nba games during November nd March lol\\nWe totally got a major problem on 1st quarter. Forcing our way to win by 1 or 10 from a large deficit is killing us and Bron minutes. Yes I love the win no doubt about it, but not the 1st quarter action. All the games they played beside Houston is all winable game if they fix that 1st quarter. I blamed the coach 1/2 not seeing it in the first couple minutes and straight them out and the other 1/2 is the starters.\\n\\nThis group can win game if not all the games if they fix that S%*T. Still believe in them!!! GO Lakers\\nOkay hard work is all we have to do to keep winning\\nJazz vs Lakers gonna be 🙌🔥\\nSo lebron will have 4.5 rings?\\nI see alot of negative feedback about the inseason tournament.... the games still counts towards regular season...\\nOnly trophy they can win this year\\nThe Jazz is silent but deadly too. Lets go Lakers and Jazz group A 💪\\nLet\\'s go Lakers! But truth be told I\\'m a little lost on this in season stuff😬\\nA win is a win! 😁\\nLet’s get this chip!! 🏅 😀\\nHow about their loss in Houston?\\n2 more wins and we are through??\\nGotta win tonight\\nwin it all\\nEasy bracket . Don’t let AD on the plane until he can make more then 4 layups and not miss. Come on bro. Consistency is what the team needs.\\nIf youll see this kind of players ,they are all tall or bigger than last season line up, but why darvin ham didnt use them to have big advantage on the paint not smallball play he\\'ll use everytime they had a game\\nLet’s go Lakers 💛💜🙌🏾🙏🏾\\U0001faf6🏾❤️\\nBest luck 💜💛💜💛\\nVando can play now!!!??\\nGood luck lakers\\nOK brothers, go get \\'em and win tonight!

All around best game LeBron\\nThey play better and harder without LeBron ...\\nShow boater, that\\'s all he is interested in.\\nOne of the best sharpshooter the game have ever seen\\nDang Sacramento came to play. And Lakers got out hustled in the game. Another learning lesson. Can\\'t win them all. But you can learn from it. I believe this where some go lol. Get them next time. Go Lakers. 🏀💯\\nHow does AD only have 4 points at the half?\\n9 points for AD, what was he doing all game? Even Barnes got more than him\\nJames brown has more to break. I love you\\nYou can’t play all the field you only trying your best.\\nEvery Other Day-vis needs to find a way to be consistent for this team to work\\n\"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n!!!!!!LEBRON JAMES\" WAY TO GO!!!!! GOD\\'S CONTINUED BLESSINGS\"\\nWell if anyone has a career as long as him of course if Kobe kept playing and live he would’ve. Steph Curry could as well.\\nIMO if it isn’t done in the same time or less it doesn’t count. He could stay in league another 20 years until he owns all the records. Doesn’t make him the goat.\\nI think A.D needs to drink vitamins and carbohydrates because he is now a problem inside the court . He can secure rebound and he plays soft for today\\'s videos.\\nTrade him. Can easy get a good tarde on some upcoming young players.\\nLebron didn’t start with strong 3 point skill. He worked very hard to develop his long range shot. I can’t help but wonder what kind of player he would be without using the long shot so much.\\nNo offense but how many more attempts, no offense lebron is a great player but not the player make him out to be, he\\'s just played longer than most\\nYear 21 and he’s still beating Jason Terry 😂😂\\nI never get caught up in total of anything, especially when someone is playing longer than just about any other player ever.\\n\\nThat being said, he has played extremely well minus some hiccups for that long career now, which he should be proud of.\\n\\nI also don\\'t consider anyone to be the goat, it diminishes what came before, or after. Also with all the rule changes from the start of the NBA and changes that\\'ll happen in the future, it isn\\'t a fair title to give anyone.\\nDavis is flat and playing soft\\nYa right. Leads the NBA in missed 3 point attempts. Kobe was better\\n1st all time in turnovers.\\nNothing like watching the Lakers lose! Love it every time!\\nEverytime he breaks a record his team gets blown out. 🤣 🤣\\nTo bad they don\\'t have a good team around him. Nothing more than a .500 team Be lucky to even make the playoffs\\nAt this point, whatever LeBron does is a record I guess 😭\\n👑King LeBron James👑\\nAmericans like to act like numbers dont matter when it comes to Bron and Drake ... this gentleman is in Top 10 of almost everything in basketball 🐐\\nStats don\\'t guarantee championships.\\nAnthony Davis is going to pad his stats in the fourth quarter make seem like he had a real good game\\nDavis playing flat and playing soft settling for 3pts if we keep playing the way we playing we are going to lose this game sad but true. . Not really. They left all of their energy on the court last night against Memphis.\\na lot of turn over and missed 3 points better luck next time guys...\\nGood luck to the next 2 quarters take care the basketball 🏀 👍\\nNo fight and a sore in the eye\\nGreat job AD!! 62 mill and you score 9 pts. Amazing effort!! Got clowned by Sabonis who makes 1/3 of what you make.\\nAD 4 points Sabonis 18 points. Anybody know where AD is?\\nThe Lakers front office should all be fired\\nAd needs to grow up man.... The season is long and as a pro u have to be ready for games like this...\\nThe only actual player that is playing and making an effort is LeBron James\\nLooks like he’s getting a boost.\\nSeriously go through every game AD has played for the lakers with an Afro. You’ll want him to braid his hair again. Trust me!\\nThe number 3 is that Wood’s twins in white version?😂 Go Lakers💪💜💛\\n2 wins, 1 loss.... This team can\\'t go in a winning streak of more than 2 or 3!\\nOnly elite teams can handle it on the 2nd night of back to backs.\\nSabonis took ADs lunch in the first half\\nAD doesn’t feel like playing tonight\\nCome on guys let get it done!!!!\\nCam reddish did his best...and all ,they wanted to take it further but it was too late wangeamka 3rd maybe wangejaribu....\\nNext on the road trail blazers here we come,make sure you go grab that win\\nAustin reaves and Anthony Davis waaw what bad game I think davis is injury but reaves turnover after turnover this man cant play PG Vincent need to come back asap\\nReddish is improving! Keep it up!💪🏻\\n. . Battling, struggling and lost to the Kings! Ayayay! 🥴\\nSquad is getting out hustled on almost every play\\nLooks like he’s helping him jump up so he could dunk it\\nMJ...would have won this game easy!!! 😂😂😂\\nTerrible game they getting blown out\\nI HOPE THERE IS NO LOVE TELECAST FOR LAKERS ... IT WILL JUST BROKE THE HEART OF THE AUDIENCE AND FANS ..\\nPlaying sloppy!!\\nTerrible night, no energy, Kings killing from behind the arc 😪\\nWe need a rebounder ASAP\\nScore update? . Hopefully AD can score more than 9 pts consider he makes $62 mil a year\\nLebron just gave the ball up twice and didn\\'t even run back on defense he walked.... they need to get rid of him... terrible attitude all because you gave them the ball.... RUN BACK ON D\\nVamos Lakers, tenemos que voltear, sí se puede!\\nFrom blowing out to getting blown out. I can\\'t with this team.

Lakers are getting to the free throw line, which is good, but they are missing their free throws…which is not good. Portland is making their free throws…Lakers missing theirs. Free throw shooting to me, is a sign of how comfortable you are playing in the game…missing free throws means you are rattled…the defense is getting to you. You guys need to take a deep breath and calm yourselves…you are missing to many free throws. If you are getting to the free throw line, it means that you are rattling the defense, not the other way around. So need to be anxious out there. .
